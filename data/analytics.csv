I'm looking for an analytics tool similar to amplitude but for one user &amp; with (ideally) unlimited history. I'm a dev so I can integrate all data I want (glucose, sleep, resting hr, hrv, food).

Things like a chart what was time to fall asleep/sleep restoration when glucose levels where under X or I ate under Y minutes before going to sleep etc. I have all the data, just need to put it somewhere &amp; analyse it.

I'm sure such thing exists, I'm just not in that space so I'm sourcing the community :) Any recommendations?

I was even couching my classmate and always in the professor’s office asking questions. Hence why I decided to forgo medical school to get my MBA. Found out I like the business education not just accounting.

I have my MBA in International Business. It was difficult for me securing a job until I land an operation/office manager job in a small home health agency. I did that for 2 years. Then I got the same role in another home health agency, I was there for another 2 years, the agency was small and was trying to sell out, so I decide to quit.

I then did retail job (brand associate) for several months and associate banker for couple months. I am now a Logistics account manager/ customer service in a warehousing company. The pay is low, but it is better than staying at home. I learned some IT applications to incorporate degrees all to no outcome.

r/analytics,"Hello friends. I’ve been faced with a difficult question and I’d really like to gather opinions. 

**Question:** 

Should I accept a job not aligned with my passion, skill set, and hopeful career trajectory, just because it’s a job?

**Backstory:**

For the past several months, while finishing an analytics master’s program, I’ve been interning with a company I love very much. I’ve worked incredibly hard for the company doing anything and everything they’ve asked and more. Everyone really seems to appreciate the contributions I’ve made. So much so that I’ve been offered a full-time position with the company. The catch is that the work I’ve been doing has been an effort to get my foot in the door, but for the most part hasn’t been directly involved with analytics/data science. 

Throughout the internship, I have been fortunate enough to let my skills shine from time to time, but it’s been pretty limited to SQL work and the occasional dashboard. I had hoped that if I was lucky enough to get an offer from the company, it’d be for a role related to the degree they knew I’d be obtaining and for the data science know-how I’d sprinkled in throughout.

Ultimately, the offer came in with a job title, responsibilities, and salary that don’t really align with analytics. I’m afraid that if I take the job I’ll instantly become a less strong candidate on paper for future jobs in the field of analytics. It feels as though I’m between a rock and a hard place, because while I like the company, the compensation and the potential long-term hindrance to my career makes the offer difficult to take. 

**TL;DR:**

* I’ve been offered a job by a company I really love, but in a role I wouldn’t love and for a low salary.
* I fear taking the job will hurt my candidacy for future jobs.
* Should I take the job simply because it’s a job during a crisis or be patient and wait for a job that won’t potentially waste my degree?

r/analytics,"Hi folks, 

I am interested in upgrading to a degree in DS/DA/BA and there are A LOT of options out there. 

I keep seeing Eastern University's Data Science program ads and I'm wondering if you lovely folks with actual experience in this field can tell me if the program is worth investing into?

 I have a science background with a strong statistics grasp (in Excel), but the CS portion (programming) is where my knowledge stops (languages, platforms, etc). This is where the program comes in, it claims to teach you the main languages used and adds some statistical training (to supplement my current knowledge).

My work is shifting around marketing analytics and sales data. There are a few bootcamps I've looked into, but they don't issue degrees and this one claims to be like a bootcamp but with the option for a degree. This seems like a plus, but schools will usually claim stuff like this so I'm turning to reddit for help in validating it.

Hello!!

I was wondering what is your opinion on these two programs careerwise. My plans were quite affected by the coronavirus pandemic and these are my current options (both are online programs)

* Msc in Analytics at Georgia institute of technology: 1 year, can be done part-time in more time and costs around $10,000 (total).
* Msc in Statistics and Data Science at KU Leuven: 2 years, no information whether it can be done part-time and costs around $2,000 (total) -&gt; The ROI might be amazing, but they told me that they were not allowed to give any information regarding placements.

My degree was mainly on economics and finance, but I have taken graduate courses in econometrics and time series analysis, although I prefer applied courses over theoretical ones -&gt; I'm not a fan of mathematical statistics.

I am interested both in the fields of social data science and risk analytics. Additionally, I would like to work in industry, but also teach some classes in the future (I have liked my experience as a T.A) and I am open to using this msc as a stepping stone towards another msc or PhD.

r/analytics,"Hi Everyone,

I have gotten great advice on here before so I thought I would ask again and maybe it can help out someone else as well!

Currently, I work in contract sales and am pursuing my MBA with a concentration in business analytics. I have been working on ways to build my portfolio where I can try to move into a business analyst role within my company.

Right now, the current BA knows basic Excel functions, basic Tableau, and basic functions in Cognos (no SQL, Python, etc). I already surpass her in skills and business acumen which is wildly frustrating (do not want her job because of the person she reports to). 

Here is the issue: I have very little access to data/reports except for the two each of the contract sales people receive (which does not have a lot of useful information). The current BA and the two levels of management above me are very protective of data and will not give me anything to work on to help the business. 

With that being said, there is hardly anything for me to create besides more functional pivot tables for the service managers, statistical tests on data to measure effectiveness of processes (they do help business needs but my boss and their boss are not big picture, creative enough people to understand how they work or how they are useful), and more creative Tableau charts that help my coworkers with warranty conversion. 

I have been as creative as I possibly know how to be but cannot find any other ways improve my skills and expand my portfolio. What are some ways to strengthen your portfolio when you are bound by a limited amount of data? 

Or KPIs are mostly centered around if customers renew their contract before expiry and if we can convert items off of warranty onto their contracts. These are not super aggressive KPIs so it is hard to think of a data driven way outside of better data visualization to solve business problems. Even if I had access to all of their data, there is not a ton that can be done to drive better results to my knowledge. 

I know this is somewhat broad, but any help is appreciated.

&amp;#x200B;

\- Mainly a behavioral type interview (according to the hiring manager)

\- Panel-style, 4 managers from various departments. However, I believe they're the ""analytics heads"" of those various departments (Marketing, Sales, etc).

\- In the job description, the only thing I don't have experience with is QMF and DB2. From what I understand, it's an IBM database that utilizes SQL? Anyone that has had experience in this care to let me know if that's something that is fairly intuitive to learn if I already am proficient in SQL? Or is this something that I should be worried about if I don't know it at all?

\- The job description also mentions automating reports and other manual processes. I don't have any experience in ""automating"" in SQL. Is this something that is mainly something that I could learn fairly easily when starting as well? Or perhaps another strike? To my understanding, the automation comes from the DBMS or whatever software I'm utilizing SQL in correct? Being that the program experience was mainly in PostgreSQL and SQLite, I have only been exposed to JOINs, UNIONs, CTEs, CASE statements, aggregate functions and sub-queries to wrangle and slice/filter data.

&amp;#x200B;

Ultimately, I'm nervous about behavioral type interview questions regarding analytics, just because the bulk of my experience comes from the coding bootcamp. Therefore, I don't have many experience ""collaborating/communicating"" with others as it pertains to this field. But the fact that most of the managers in the panel are not in the HR area makes me feel a bit better but worse at the same time. I'm trying to think of what they could ask, as someone who isn't in the HR department, but knows that this candidate will be responsible for analytics in that department. I'm guessing if anything, they'll be more broad type behavioral questions. Any insight or ideas on what they might ask would be much appreciated.

&amp;#x200B;

On a side note, is there any way to best say something that translates to ""I've never had any experience in a situation like that"" for questions where I might blank or literally have no experience in?

r/analytics,"Hi - I'm a fairly experienced marketer trying to track our signup rate. My company has a multistep signup process and I'm completely lost. Thanks for any help you can provide.

**Current Setup:**

My company has a consumer tool that requires signup to use. The signup process is 6+ ugly pages in broken english that could be condensed into 1; at one point you have to leave, confirm your email, sign in again, and complete the process (no valid policy reason for this). I have been advocating for basic emergency changes for months; our CTO who built it refuses all changes, a/b tests or tracking software.

**Current Metrics:**

We're using GA to count unique pageviews on final page/number of unique pageviews on first page to estimate our conversion rate. 

CTO claims our CR is 80% based on this unique pageviews metric. CEO finally suspects something is wrong (bounce rate on signup page is 45%, too high to support pageviews at end of funnel) and has asked me to get info to support alternative view.

So we have a GA goal set up that triggers when a user goes from first signup page to intermediate signup page to final page. It consistently shows 27% CR. I'm not confident this ""tracks signups"" though. Different traffic sources (3rd party sites direct to signup page, which I crosscheck with UTMs) have indicated that our real CR is, obviously, anywhere from 10% to 35%. 

**Questions**

Q: Does GA goal track all users or just those who begin the goal?

Q: I've reached the limit of my technical ability. Where do I look from here to build an easy way to track signup rate, if this isn't working?

r/analytics,"About 5-6 months ago I made [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/analytics/comments/f0io46/is_mapping_just_a_gimmick_or_is_there_actual/) posing a question about whether or not GIS/Mapping was a legit analytical tool, or just a a gimmick. Well, I'd like to follow up on that and say: Yes.

Like last time I want to iterate that I do work for a Mapping SaaS company, so my opinion will be biased. I'll refer to my company (if ever) as NeatMaps, which is obviously not what its called. I want to provide 3 examples of how GIS can really move the needle for some companies.

&amp;#x200B;

**1.**  **WHERE IS THE MONEY**

This is probably the most common issue that comes up when I work with our clients. It's a simple matter of knowing WHERE everything actually is. But why would that matter? Well, lets say that you know that 10 stores are performing well. Well, what geographic factors could be affecting that? How many competitors are within 3 miles? What about 10 or 20? If you take those 10 stores, what are the income levels surrounding those stores? The demographic breakdown of those living near those stores? How close are those stores to our distributors? How much do they cost in distance to upkeep?

Now what if we want to open a new store? How do we determine or project the success of that store based on the above mentioned stores? What if we could find the ideal geographical factors of supporting a store (#of competitors, demographics, and distance from other stores) to project how successful we expect this store to be? 

That's a small sample of knowing WHERE things are good or bad. There's tons of tools to break down data by segments, but many of them to a (frankly) crap job of taking into account matters of geography beyond what county or state are they in.

&amp;#x200B;

**2. DISTANCE IS POWER**

A classic example of this use case is oil industry. Anyone who has worked in oil will know that every mile you have is precious. Being able to say ""Look, we are within 5 minute drive of you for 90% of your stations or terminals"" gets deals done. Just by proving and seeing that you are physically the closest option for people can often be the biggest selling point for some situations. So knowing what your geographic network is, how dense or spread out you might be for some markets, can be game changing.

&amp;#x200B;

**3. MARKET RESEARCH**

This one is similar to point number one, but it has a slightly different goal so I wanted to give it a separate call out. What if you could have every sale in the past 6 months on a map, what would that do for you? Well, you can start to figure out your market penetration. Let's say you plot 6 months of sales on a map, and around each sale you know how far away the nearest sale is, how many other sales you have within 10 miles of this one, and you know how many people of your target market (say married people over the age of 60) live near by those sales. Then you take the number of sales within 10 miles, the number of people within 10 miles and you know your market penetration. For every sale. 

Now you know immediately what sales are in a market that is getting too saturated, and what sales are in a market with a lot of elbow room to grow.

\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

These are all fairly high level, grossly simplified examples, but I wanted to put an idea in some peoples heads. After all, rule #4 states ""Let's help each other with techniques rather than tools"". That's my goal with Maps. The potential behind the geography of data is obscene, and if you haven't look into it in the past.

I come from a Marketing background (Bachelors in it and have held a few positions over the few years since graduating in the field). However, I'm in the process of transitioning into a Data Analyst and eventually into a Data Scientist. But, I'm having a lot of trouble prioritizing some specific skills needed to land my first junior level Data Analyst job. Here's the rundown: I just came out of a data analytics program from an online bootcamp (6 months). I've learned to be proficient in Excel, SQL, Python and Tableau as it pertains to data analytics. In Excel, I was able to solidify my understanding of VLOOKUPs, pivot tables, graphs, and ultimately cleaning and organizing data and building out some models/dashboards all within Excel. So I feel very confident in my Excel abilities as it pertains to a junior level data analyst position. But with SQL I have a little less confidence in my abilities after the program, as I know some complex queries utilizing  JOINS, UNIONs, CTEs, sub-queries, CASE statements, and the such for organizing, slicing and aggregating data. But nothing in regards to data warehousing or building out/maintaining databases and exporting reports. Being that I don't know what the work environment calls for in regards to SQL, I'm not sure if what I know in that language is sufficient enough or if I should be looking deeper into the language right now. I also feel a bit overwhelmed with Python after coming out of the course. We've touched on many topics like numpy, pandas, seaborn, matplotlib, scipy, BeautifulSoup, and how to web scrape and request APIs. However, I feel like with all these concepts, it's just the foundational/surface level stuff. Tableau I feel a bit more comfortable with, as I feel like it's fairly intuitive, as far as some of the more basic functions of creating various visuals and dashboards/stories.

But with all this, I'm still stuck at what I should be consistently learning right now in order to land my FIRST real data analyst job. Again, it's overwhelming because so many junior level positions are asking so many different things, sometimes not involving Python and only SQL, and then vice versa. And then they throw in other tools that I have no familiarity in, like Spark, AWS, Google Analytics, etc. So I'm confused as to if I should refine some skills that I already know like SQL or if I need to look into those specific tools like Google Analytics that the program hasn't taught me. 

Any guidance as to what I should really dig deep on in order to give me an edge in MOST junior level positions? I'm leaning towards SQL, but I'm not entirely sure, being that I don't know if my current level of proficiency is enough for a junior level. If it is, then I'd rather spend more time in Python and such.

r/analytics,"(Reposting as it was removed because of a link to a blog)...

I’m working on a list of walk-throughs for a list of statistical methods used for digital marketing.

The steps for each walk-through would be:

1. what we're trying to achieve or optimise towards,
2. the statistical method to apply,
3. the data needed and the structure it needs to be in,
4. the R scripts and libraries to use while noting which variables to replace and parameters to adjust,
5. interpretation of the results.

This wouldn’t be a replacement for an analyst’s subject matter expertise, creativity, business acumen, communication skills or common sense. And it wouldn’t cover data cleaning and formatting or communication (there are already loads of tutorials in these areas).

The idea is that based on what the analyst would want to do, they’d need to source the relevant data, explore it, clean/format it and structure it accordingly before applying the applicable R scripts against it and interpreting and communicating the results.

The reason I’m saying R instead of Python is because I think R has an easier way to implement the statistical methods required to get the results and is more conducive to the end of goal of digital analysts and marketeers. Plus I found it a lot easier to setup and use than Python!

As data analysts we already spend a lot of time on measurement tool configuration, data collection, data cleaning and basic reporting &amp; dashboard building that we barely get time to do deep analysis and curation of the story from the data.

Anyway, the below list is what I have so far:

1. **AB testing &amp; experiments (same period):** using t-test, chi-square, etc. Used to compare the conversion rate or CTR or other key ratio between ad(s), campaign(s) and/or audience(s). This is usually done during the same period to exclude the effects of seasonality. 
2. **AB testing &amp; experiments (different periods):**  Used for identifying if a campaign or some other change has resulted in an increase in conversions or other target results. This is specifically for comparing one period against another period. An example would be to estimate how much of an increase in site visits after running a TV campaign was due to the TV campaign. This is usually asked as “what is the incremental increase in metric X due to event Y”.  The statistical method used is causal inference using Bayesian structural time-series models. 
3. **Algorithmic digital attribution:** using Markov Chain/Shapely Values against conversion path data from GA MCF or DCM Attribution. Would be great to be able to use Facebook Advanced Attribution data as well but unfortunately they don’t provide conversion paths.
4. **Forecasting of sales/visits/any metric on a trend line:**  Used to forecast a metric (such as sales/visits/any metric) on a daily, weekly or any periodic trend line. Using Facebook’s Prophet library and ARIMA. Using Monte Carlo forecasting to take into account multiple variables.
5. **Media mix modelling:** using regression and taking into account seasonality and ad stock. Using FB Prophet and others.
6. **Product recommendations:** using collaborative filtering. This can be used to show products in the footer of cart pages for upsell or for email marketing.
7. **Lead scoring:** using logistic regression or others. Used to prioritise which customers to contact as they would have the features most associated with likely customers.
8. **Customer segmentation analysis:** using RFM scoring. Used to send different messages to different segments via email or social advertising.
9. ***Can you think of anything else?....***",t2_j3crk,"Need help to write a ""Digital Marketing Analytics Cookbook"" - Updated",,t3_hqwhxk,0.93,39,Discussion,39,1594737371.0,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reposting as it was removed because of a link to a blog)...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As data analysts we already spend a lot of time on measurement tool configuration, data collection, data cleaning and basic reporting &amp;amp; dashboard building that we barely get time to do deep analysis and curation of the story from the data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, the below list is what I have so far:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AB testing &amp;amp; experiments (same period):&lt;/strong&gt; using t-test, chi-square, etc. Used to compare the conversion rate or CTR or other key ratio between ad(s), campaign(s) and/or audience(s). This is usually done during the same period to exclude the effects of seasonality. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AB testing &amp;amp; experiments (different periods):&lt;/strong&gt;  Used for identifying if a campaign or some other change has resulted in an increase in conversions or other target results. This is specifically for comparing one period against another period. An example would be to estimate how much of an increase in site visits after running a TV campaign was due to the TV campaign. This is usually asked as “what is the incremental increase in metric X due to event Y”.  The statistical method used is causal inference using Bayesian structural time-series models. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Algorithmic digital attribution:&lt;/strong&gt; using Markov Chain/Shapely Values against conversion path data from GA MCF or DCM Attribution. Would be great to be able to use Facebook Advanced Attribution data as well but unfortunately they don’t provide conversion paths.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Forecasting of sales/visits/any metric on a trend line:&lt;/strong&gt;  Used to forecast a metric (such as sales/visits/any metric) on a daily, weekly or any periodic trend line. Using Facebook’s Prophet library and ARIMA. Using Monte Carlo forecasting to take into account multiple variables.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Media mix modelling:&lt;/strong&gt; using regression and taking into account seasonality and ad stock. Using FB Prophet and others.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Product recommendations:&lt;/strong&gt; using collaborative filtering. This can be used to show products in the footer of cart pages for upsell or for email marketing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lead scoring:&lt;/strong&gt; using logistic regression or others. Used to prioritise which customers to contact as they would have the features most associated with likely customers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Customer segmentation analysis:&lt;/strong&gt; using RFM scoring. Used to send different messages to different segments via email or social advertising.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Can you think of anything else?....&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

r/analytics,"Hi /r/analytics,

as you know, Dark Mode for all the things is all the rage these days and if you don't offer a dimly lit version of your website or app, you suck. Apparently. While I do use dark mode on my phone (where it can [save significant power and thereby improve battery life](http://mobileenerlytics.com/dark-mode/)), I think most other uses are the Matrix Raining Code screen saver of our time and actively supporting it is a waste of development resources.

If you, too, want to support or refute this assertion, this is how you can track the usage of Dark Mode on your website with Google Tag Manager and Google Analytics as a custom dimension:

## Create a Google Tag Manager variable

Using the [matchMedia](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/matchMedia) interface of the `window` object wie can check the `prefers-color-scheme` media feature to detect whether or not the user has configured the system with a light or a dark color scheme.

This Custom JavaScript variable will return `dark` true if dark mode is active and `light` if it isn't.

    function(){
        return (window.matchMedia &amp;&amp; window.matchMedia('(prefers-color-scheme: dark)').matches) ? ""dark"" : ""light""
    }

Paste this into GTM like so:

[Screenshot](https://hume.dev/img/articles/dark-mode/colorscheme-js-variable.jpg)

## Update Google Analytics configuration

First, make sure you have a spare Google Analytics custom dimension and make note of the variable index you want to use (marked in red):

[Screenshot](https://hume.dev/img/articles/dark-mode/analytics-dimension-color-scheme.jpg)

If you're not sure which [scope](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/2709828?hl=en) is right for you, use ""Hit"".

Now, back in Google Tag Manager, edit your Google Analytics tag or your Google Analytics settings variable to incorporate the `dark` or `light` value into your tracking request:

[Screenshot](https://hume.dev/img/articles/dark-mode/color-scheme-settings.jpg)

Great, that's it, you can go ahead and publish your GTM container! If you want to validate right away if your implementation was successful, check our your Google Analytics request to see the custom dimension parameter:

[Screenshot](https://hume.dev/img/articles/dark-mode/request-dark.jpg)

[Screenshot](https://hume.dev/img/articles/dark-mode/request-light.jpg)

## Track dark / light mode switch

If you really want to go all in, you can also track changes to the preferred color scheme and push an event to dataLayer in case the user decides to update her or his preferences:

    window.matchMedia('(prefers-color-scheme: dark)').addEventListener('change', e =&gt; {
        var newColorScheme = e.matches ? ""dark"" : ""light"";
        window.dataLayer = window.dataLayer || []
        window.dataLayer.push({
            event: ""colorScheme"",
            newColorScheme: newColorScheme
        })
    });

Considering this will almost never happen, it's pretty pointless though.

How many of your users use Dark Mode?

&lt;li&gt;Learn Excel (with macros VBA) and read ISLR cover to cover by devoting 2 hrs for each everyday for a month. Also revise and practice SQL, and pick-up intermediate to advanced topics in it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Focus on visualization in excel and learn Tableaux for another month; Work on some projects with R, 2 hrs each&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How ready do you think I&amp;#39;d be by October if I stick to this schedule religiously? Do you think it&amp;#39;s possible to get an internship in DA with the above mentioned skills?&lt;/p&gt;

r/analytics,"Hey everyone! I just wanted to see if I could get some advice being that I am new to the field. I recently graduated with my MS in Analytics from a good school in Washington, DC. Since graduating, the job search has been rough. I didn’t come from a computer/data science background so analytics was a complete 180 for me career wise. I did well in my program (3.5 gpa) but I am now realizing that my knowledge of software tools is behind the power curve. I’m not proficient with anything like SQL, R, Python, Power BI etc. I am novice with Tableau and am just now beginning to learn R via linkedin learning. When looking for data analyst/scientist jobs, these tools are essential qualifications as is some years of experience (even at entry level openings). I feel that until I learn these tools nobody is even going to consider me and that’s going to take some time. What would your advice be if you were in my position? Thanks!

**EDIT**

I just wanted to clarify what experience I actually do have from the program.

I only had two courses that covered anything related to tools. Database and Big Data briefly covered some basic SQL commands but was primarily based around concepts (ie relational database structure, foreign keys etc) and predictive analytics which was heavy on R but advanced and fast paced for someone with no prior R experience so I was struggling. Besides that, no emphasis placed on tools or learning them. The next time I used tools was in the capstone in which I had a practicum with the Special Olympics. I was given raw data on their athletes health records to see if I could predict oral diseases. I cleaned/sorted the data with excel, imported it into R as a .csv and did some basic statistical analysis/visualizations. I also used tableau for more visualizations and presented my findings a panel of data scientists at the Special Olympics and professors in our program for critique. A rundown of the courses I took would be: 
applied managerial statistics, database and big data (some SQL), management information systems, business insights through analytics, predictive analytics (used R), business intelligence, management of organizations and human capital, strategic thinking for decisions, business law and ethics, a two semester capstone practicum and some cybersec courses for a concentration.",t2_10xeoapy,New to the analytics field!

r/analytics,"Hello everyone,

I'm an aspiring analyst who is looking to pivot from my current marketing role. Ive already started learning the technical skills with a combination on LinkedIn learning and Marketing Analytics by Wayne L. Winston (Book). My current role is in Marketing and it is purely content creation and some sales training.

The sub usually suggests that the best way to pick up practical skills is by volunteering to help out with  some analytics for your current company. I unfortunately work in a biggish firm where there are dedicated teams for each function and so I cannot offer to learn/help the analytics team in any way, by company rules. ( Yes  I did ask a friend of mine in those teams and he said they expect prior experience and high technical skills for someone to move internally. And they are not interested in sharing the data as well). Every function has an analytics team that runs everything from campaign performance to customer churn rate to bills/invoices etcc... 

With the current COVID scenario, I cannot afford to antagonize anyone at work in the first place, so looking at helping internally is out of the question. My question now is

1. How do i start to build a portfolio of the projects ? I already started reaching out to people on Fiver/Upwork etc.. even offering to work for free in return for experience, but I have had ZERO success.
2. VERY DUMB QUESTION but Where do I showcase this portfolio?For ex.

If I'm a writer, I can show bylines/blogs etcc.  
If I'm a designer, Maybe on Behance/Dribble.

&amp;#x200B;

I work on a Data Warehousing team for a wholesale / retail company. We are in charge of building out our analytics platforms, and helping our organization realize analytical potential outside of reporting. 

I have been running into a few issues regarding testing that I wanted to talk about. 

A little background: a lot of our initial Data Warehouse build has been around current reporting - kind of as a baseline. We're now expanding into other Use Cases that the organization currently doesn't have insight into; this is the exciting stuff! We utilize the Microsoft Stack (Azure, Databricks, SSMS, etc.) in building out the Data Warehouse / Lake, and are utilizing Analysis Services and Power BI to build models / reporting. Much of the modeling will move into Power BI (someday). We have a plethora of different ERP systems / PLM systems that house master data and transactional data. We're working on bringing all of these together into the Data Warehouse to provide a consistent voice in our data / business process. 

I am looking to better automate how I do my current testing. As I said above, a lot of our initial build has been based off of current reporting. Thus, in our testing, we do a lot of comparison against current reporting to match numbers. A lot of this is a manual disaster: having to go into a current report, pick parameters, query similar parameters in the Data Warehouse (usually Excel or Power BI), bring both results into an Excel sheet, do some variance analysis, rinse / repeat. I am looking to better automate this process so I don't have to do such extreme manual testing.

r/analytics,"Hello,

I have a question related to the standard metric used to evaluate subscription model businesses, aka **user retention**.

We define user retention as *the percentage of customers that keep their subscription active over time*; retention can be associated with a specific *cohort* \- aka a sub-group of users that share a characteristic - in a business scenario,  all the users acquired over the course of a given month.

Now let's suppose I have an imaginary internet company - **florify.com**. :). 

This company is a subscription model that ships fresh flower bouquets every month to your door. 

Users can purchase two kinds of subscriptions, **with different contract billing cycles:**  

1. **Monthly Plans**: the user gets billed each 30 days.
2. **3-Months Prepaid Plans**: the user pays in advance every 3 months, with a 30% discount.

The userbase is then composed of two groups - monthly and prepaid users; the proportion of the two groups varies over time, but it usually stays stable around 80% monthly users vs. 20% prepaid users. 

Let's imagine I have enough historical data to observe the previous 36 months retention rates, collected in [this google docs](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1dRsr1ju0KBSFl7wSgiWYcBMgqxPpD3cRGpfyAD1WpgQ/edit#gid=0).

The document contains 2 tables: 

1. **Monthly Plans Retention Rate**, It is expressed as a percentage. At the first period (ie, the acquisition period) the percentage of retained customers is of course 100%, then it goes to 73% at the second period, 45% at the third and so on until the 36th period - when only the 5% of the initially acquired customers are still active.
2. **Prepaid Plans Retention Rate.** It is similarly expressed as a percentage, but each period accounts for 90 days (3 months). At the first period (ie, the acquisition period - aka the months 1,2 and 3) the percentage of retained customers is 100%; at the second period (ie. months 4,5 and 6), 55% of customers are still active and so on until the 12th period (ie. months 34,35 and 36), when only the 5% of the initially acquired customers are still active.

My question is: given the two group's historical retention rates in the previous 36 months, how can I calculate the *""blended retention rate""*?

For the *""blended* *retention rate""*,  I mean the composed *""sum""* of the retention rates of monthly and prepaid orders. 

I start from the assumption that the prepaid users' retention rate can be intended as a monthly users retention rate that stays the same every 3 months; it might sound like a stupid question, but I would like to understand how to ""normalize"" the two rates and unify them in a single KPI. 

Any help, advise or comment is extremely appreciated!

r/analytics,"Hi Everyone,

I had my first post on here yesterday which yielded fantastic advice that I appreciate greatly. This has led me to another series of questions regarding a career in analytics.

--- I work in sales and am actively trying to find data to collect and process in a meaningful way. I have made a few pretty cool analysis using paired t test with various data and regressions. The only downside is I am very limited with the data I have access to and our, ""data analysis"" person in our department is inept to say the least and would not share information and not offer much help.

&lt;p&gt;I had my first post on here yesterday which yielded fantastic advice that I appreciate greatly. This has led me to another series of questions regarding a career in analytics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;--- I work in sales and am actively trying to find data to collect and process in a meaningful way. I have made a few pretty cool analysis using paired t test with various data and regressions. The only downside is I am very limited with the data I have access to and our, &amp;quot;data analysis&amp;quot; person in our department is inept to say the least and would not share information and not offer much help.

r/analytics,"How would I go about testing for differences in cost per acquisition (CPA) in an A/B test?

I'm  a huge novice and am unsure if I would use some kind of t-test or  chi-square test (or neither) to compare the proportion of cost per   acquisition in group A to cost per acquisition in group B.

e.g.

**Group A:**

Cost: £1500

Acquisitions: 30

CPA: £50

**Group B:**

Cost: £3000

Acquisitions: 50

CPA: £60

For  context, this is an experiment for a digital advertising campaign  and  has associated clicks and impressions. Cost is determined by click   volume and cost per click.

Any help would be super appreciated.

Hi Everyone!

Quick Run Down of experience:

\---BS in Political Science from a decent undergrad school

\---Five years professional experience (healthcare sales, insurance, international logistics)

\---Currently working in Healthcare/Life Science Sales

\---Healthcare MBA Candidate

The MBA program I am in is heavily centered around descriptive data analytics/ advanced Excel usage which initially scared me to death but now I love it! Prior to this program I only had a basic understanding of Excel and now I am doing hypothesis testing, decision analysis, ANOVA, regression, etc which inspired me to pursue analytics.

Now for a few questions:

\--- I am currently working in healthcare sales and want to stay in that field for now. How does one even get started in analytics and how on Earth do you know when you are even ready for the leap? After my courses, I would consider myself advanced with Excel and understand different types of hypothesis testing but outside of classwork, I have never put it to use in the real world. What are the logical steps forward when you have the skills needed but have not actually applied them yet and how do you know you are ready?

\--- When you do realize you are ready, what type of jobs do you even apply for that are relevant to those skills? What job titles specifically do you look for that are in the realm of business analytics? I would like to do something where stats are involved because the hypothesis testing, probabilities, ANOVA, and all of those skills were fun to me. 

\--- People that have careers in business analysis, what skills do you use the most in each program and which ones are the most valuable?

\--- I have read online that you need a basic understanding of SQL, R, Tableau, and Python in addition to advanced Excel skills. What are the best and most cost efficient ways to get good enough with those programs? Also, how do you know when you are, ""good enough""?

\--- Since I wrapped up Descriptive Analytics, it be worthwhile to take the more advanced analytics courses at my university (Prescriptive Analytics, Predictive Analytics, and Business Intelligence)?

\--- What steps should I take right now in order to be ready for a job in this field when I graduate in 2022?

I've Googled this pretty hard and can't find an answer, so I think this is the most appropriate subreddit to ask!

I have a few sites set up in Google Analytics, as I'm sure most people do, I need to compare a couple of sites side by side sometimes.

Toggling through the sites on the mobile app is nothing short of frustrating, and opening two or more browsers sessions and resizing them side by side is a bit annoying too.

So, I was wondering, is there a tool/app or something that would allow me to open 2-4 site's analytics in the same browser window or something?

I don't want to compare them by overlapping data in the same graph, rather seeing them in separate windows.

r/analytics,"Forecasting the dynamics of revenue, audience, and other key metrics is an important process for any product that is in its growth phase. Having a good forecast helps to prioritize projects at the planning stage, and then helps to keep track of how quickly you are growing against the forecast, allowing you to spot problems as early as possible.

The very process of creating a forecasting model allows you to synchronize the team in terms of understanding the product’s growth model. It also provides a tool for assessing the impact of working on different areas of the model.

Today we will talk about building audience and revenue forecasts for your product using cohort analysis. We will also find out the pitfalls and difficulties of this process.

## Cohort analysis is the basis for forecasting audience, revenue, and other business metrics for your app

Cohort analysis is the basis for predicting the dynamics of the key metrics of your business.

This metric divides users into cohorts based on the month they started using the product.

This means that if you build the forecast of a certain metric for a specific cohort of users (those who started using the product in month X) then you can easily project the forecast to the entire product. Thus, the forecast of the entire product can be simplified by scaling it down to a single cohort, which is easier to study. Since the process will be identical among cohorts, the results can then be scaled up to the entire product.  
Forecasting the dynamics of the key metrics for a cohort of users is relatively easy because you can obtain it by analyzing historical data on older cohorts.

Now that we’ve discussed the basic idea behind building metric forecasts for a product, we can get into the different aspects of the process:

* Understanding the relation between the metrics (audience numbers, retention, revenue, etc.) of individual cohorts and the entire product
* Predicting the dynamics of revenue, audience and other metrics for a specific cohort of users
* Predicting the size of the cohorts that will come to the product in the future
* Using Google Sheet templates to predict revenue, audience numbers, and other metrics
* Understanding the nuances, pitfalls and difficulties within the process of building the forecast.

## Understanding the relation between the metrics (audience numbers, retention, revenue, etc.) of individual cohorts and the entire product

Consider the following product, let’s call it X.

### First month after launch

You launch product X in January 2019. In January (the first month after the launch), 1,000 new users come to the product, and they spend $100.

In January, the app’s MAU will be 1,000 users, and the revenue will be $100, since at the moment, the product is entirely represented by one cohort of users who came in January.

### Second month after launch

In February 2019, another thousand new users join the product. They spend another $100. At the same time, 700 of the users who came in January are retained in February. These users spend $70.

Thus, in February (the second month after the launch), the product’s MAU will be composed of the February cohort of active users (1,000 people) and what remains of the January cohort (700 retained users). That is, the audience will equal 1,000 + 700 = 1,700 users.

Revenue in the second month will be equal to $100 + $70 = $170. It will also encompass the revenue of the two currently available cohorts of users.

### Third month after launch

As in previous months, in March, we will add a third cohort of users (people who started using the product in March).The overall metrics will be the sum of metrics for the January, February and March cohorts at the end of March.

### Month-N after launch

When we reach the end of month N after the launch, we will have N cohorts of users based on the month the users started using the product. The MAU for the entire product for month N will be equal to the sum of the audiences of each of the available cohorts in month N.

### Why did we present the audience and revenue for each month as the sum of these metrics for individual cohorts?

The goal of this exercise was to show that the key metrics of your product in any month are directly determined by their corresponding values ​​in the cohorts of users, created based on the date the users joined the product.

This means that if we can predict the metric for all cohorts of users for a specific month, then we can easily get a forecast of this metric for the entire product (by summing the values ​​from all cohorts).

## Predicting the dynamics of revenue, audience numbers and other metrics for a specific cohort of users

Predicting the dynamics of revenue, audience, or any other metric for a particular cohort of users is relatively simple. To do this, you need to use the cohort’s historical data.

Usually, you need to take the oldest relevant product cohorts in order to get their actual dynamics, and then project this dynamics to the new cohorts.

For example, to predict a monthly active audience (MAU), you can take the following steps:

1. Take an old relevant cohort of users and calculate the MAU for this cohort by month. By “relevant” I mean that the cohort must reflect the current state of the product. In this context, a cohort that has existed before a major change to the product does not qualify as relevant.
2. Divide the resulting set of values ​​by the size of the cohort (the number of users in the cohort). At this step you will obtain the monthly retention rate.
3. Using monthly retention, you can easily predict what will be the audience of a particular cohort of users for any month. To do this, multiply the size of the cohort by the retention rate of the corresponding month.
4. If you need to get the dynamics of the predicted metric for months that go beyond what you can get on the basis of the oldest relevant cohorts, you will need to make an assumption about the metric’s future dynamics:

* For example, if the cohort’s audience has been steadily decreasing by 3% every month starting from some point in time, then you can assume that the same trend will continue in the upcoming months.
* If the metric seems stable, you can assume that it won’t change in the coming months.
* There is no universal approach to this task. You will need to decide on a case-by-case basis.

Let’s look at how this will work in the example of the app X that we examined earlier in this essay.

1. We take those who came in January 2019 as an old relevant cohort of users.

2. Based on this cohort, we calculate the monthly retention rate of our product. To do this, we need to divide the audience number by the size of the cohort (1,000 users).

3. Now we can make the MAU forecast of other cohorts for the month we are interested in. For example, the Month 4 MAU of the cohort that came in May 2019 will be equal to the number of users in this cohort multiplied by 4th month retention (1,000 \* 70% = 700).

4. If we want to predict what the cohort’s MAU will be on Month 7, then we will need to assume what will happen with the monthly retention rate.

In our case, the task is simple: retention has remained steady since Month 1, so we can assume that it will remain the same in the following months. As we collect more data in the future, we can modify the forecast if we observe any changes to the retention rate.

The same procedure will help you to predict any other growth metric. Let’s see how this works on the product’s revenue forecast:

1. Take an old relevant cohort of users and calculate its month-by-month revenue.
2. Divide the resulting set of values ​​by the size of the cohort (the number of users in the cohort). At this point, you will receive an approximate revenue retention rate for a cohort of users.
3. Using the metric above, you can easily predict what the revenue of a particular cohort of users will be for any month. To do this, you need to multiply the cohort size by the value of the metric calculated in the previous step for the corresponding month.
4. If you need to obtain the dynamics of the predicted metric for months that go beyond what you can get on the basis of the oldest relevant cohorts, you will need to make an assumption about the future dynamics of the metric.

Forecasting metrics for a cohort of users is simple: first we get the data on how this metric changes for some old relevant cohort, and then we assume that other cohorts will have similar dynamics.

## Predicting the size of the future product’s cohorts

The last missing piece for creating a revenue or audience forecast is information about the size of future cohorts of users who will come to your product. That is, creating a forecast for the number of new users.

There is no universal way to predict the future number of new users, since the growth models of different products are fundamentally different.

To solve this problem, you will need to build a forecast of the number of new users for each of the distribution channels, based on the available levers and the limitations each of them has.

## Using Excel / Google Spreadsheet template to project audience numbers, revenue and other product metrics

At this point, we’ve have already discussed:

* How to forecast the number of new users in the future (i.e., estimated size of the future cohorts).
* How to forecast active users, revenue or other metrics for a specific cohort of users.
* How the metrics of user cohorts, selected based on the date users joined the product, make up the metrics of the entire product.

If you understand the logic behind all the above steps, then creating a forecast becomes a solely technical task.

You can find an example template for forecasting product revenue here \[[file](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1atuXlLQSrjIHEoscPeL8un8pbCn-Z_S9YhEg3-qWig8/edit#gid=0)\].

In this file, we forecast revenue for a product that was launched in January 2015. The forecast was made in October 2019. All the actual data in the file is highlighted in blue, and all of the forecast data is highlighted in yellow.

Creating a forecast works as follows:

1. We calculated the month-by-month revenue of the users of the oldest cohort (see row 11 in the file).
2. We divided the result from the previous step by the number of users in the cohort (see row 12 in the file).
3. We made a forecast of the number of new users from October 2019 to the last month that we want to have the forecast for.
4. Based on the vale obtained in step 2, we built a revenue forecast for all product cohorts, created based on the month users started using the product.
5. The only thing left is to add the values ​​of the cohorts in the right way to get the revenue of the whole product in future months.

Read all about how this forecasting approach is applied in practice in a previous essay where I talked about the future of Calm and other subscription-based apps after [the changes made in iOS 13.](https://gopractice.io/blog/change-in-ios-13-that-might-end-calm-1b-valuation/)

## Improving revenue and audience forecasting models for the app

### Make separate forecasts for the key audience segments

One way to improve the quality of forecasts is to calculate individual forecasts for the key segments of the audience.

For example, you can make separate forecasts for different distribution channels or for different markets where your business is represented.

The allocation of individual segments makes sense when the dynamics of the predicted metric in these segments is significantly different, or when the segments are governed by different laws (different levels of competition, different growth drivers). If you do not make forecasts for individual segments, then you may face a problem when the dynamics of the cohort’s metric will strongly depend on the distribution of users by the segments, which can change over time.

### Make sure to consider the future impact of product and marketing changes on the model’s key metrics

If you’re making a forecast for a year or a longer period of time, then it makes sense to consider how the team’s work will affect retention, monetization, and acquisition of new users over the year. Reflecting potential future changes in the model will depend on the kind of changes and the effects you expect from them.

Some companies make forecasts for the basic scenario where they assume there will be no significant changes to the core product metrics. This forecast is considered as the minimum expected level of product growth.

### Add seasonality to the forecast model

When calculating the dynamics of the metric based on the historical data, the seasonal effects are likely to smooth out or disappear. Seasonality has a strong impact in many industries, so it is important to make sure to correctly reflect this in your forecast.

Seasonality can be addressed in one of two ways: Either you can add it at the coefficient level for the total value of the metric for the entire business (coefficients for specific months of the year), or you can factor it in at the level of dynamics of the specific cohorts.

The second option gives a more accurate result, but it is more expensive to implement. The first option is simpler, but in some cases it may poorly reflect the influence of seasonality (especially if the product is going through rapid growth).

### Complete the forecast with other metrics that characterize your business

Often, after building a revenue and audience forecast and other key high-level metrics of your business, you can easily build an expected future P&amp;L or any other kind of reports.

For example, this way you can evaluate the future cash flows of your company, and understand how much money you can invest in new experimental products/projects next year.

## Pitfalls to avoid when forecasting revenue and audience numbers

### Prediction issues for apps with strong long-term retention

If you are working on an app with a stable long-term retention, and you are using a device\_id (device characteristic) as a unique user identifier in the analytics system, then you will encounter a rather unusual problem.

People change phones every year or every year and a half. If you consider a specific user who did this, then at the time of changing his device the following will happen:

* Activity from the original device\_id will disappear, which will be reflected in the data as a decrease in the retention rate.
* If the user installs the product on a new device, a new user will appear in the analytics system with a new device\_id, which will be reflected in the data as the growth of the new users.
* The problem occurs because this supposed “new user” will behave differently than usual new users.

This may seem like a minor problem at first glance, but it will have a strong impact on forecasts for products that have solid long-term retention rates. Forecasts hinge on being able to create accurate user cohorts. Without being able to place users in their respective cohorts, the forecasts made on their behavior will become inaccurate over time.

You can solve this problem by asking users to create an account in your product, so you will be able to identify them when they log in from a new device. You can also use more sophisticated ways to identify users based on their addresses or other data.

Some services make use of an unusual approach and form cohorts based on the moment users make their first purchase. Thus they make forecasts only with the customers and not any user. Everything that happens before the user’s first purchase in this case can be considered as part of a marketing funnel.

Slack uses this approach. This became clear when they published their data before going public. You can read more about Slack and their business model [here](https://gopractice.io/blog/slack-vs-teams-as-we-go-remote/), [here](https://gopractice.io/blog/slack-vs-teams-vs-workplace/) and [here](https://gopractice.io/blog/slack-ipo-reading-between-lines/).

### Your forecast ignores what is not included in the historical data

We used historical data to make forecasts. Therefore, in fact, we got a forecast of what will happen if everything stays the same as it was before.

As we found out during the COVID-19 pandemic, life and the world around us can change quite rapidly, and we cannot take such effects into account in advance. But at the same time, such a forecasting model gives you all the tools to conduct various kinds of stress tests on your product and evaluate their impact on high-level and business metrics.

For example, you can consider a scenario where the influx of the new users will be five times greater in order to assess the impact on the number of active users and understand how many servers you will need to support your product.

## You must have a deep understanding of the product’s growth model to build a high-quality accurate forecast

The described approach to forecasting is quite universal. It works for any metrics and for almost any kind of products and businesses. The quality of the forecast mainly depends on how well you understand your product, its growth model and the internal dynamics of the distribution channels and the market.

It is also crucial to understand that forecasting is a tool for exploring your product, finding the levers to drive key metrics, and conduct stress tests. A good model will allow you to evaluate the impact of various potential projects and development vectors on the topline metrics of your business.",t2_2c30i,How to forecast key product metrics through cohort analysis,,t3_hbeoyt,0.5,0,,0,1592516104.0,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Forecasting the dynamics of revenue, audience, and other key metrics is an important process for any product that is in its growth phase. Having a good forecast helps to prioritize projects at the planning stage, and then helps to keep track of how quickly you are growing against the forecast, allowing you to spot problems as early as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The very process of creating a forecasting model allows you to synchronize the team in terms of understanding the product’s growth model. It also provides a tool for assessing the impact of working on different areas of the model.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today we will talk about building audience and revenue forecasts for your product using cohort analysis. We will also find out the pitfalls and difficulties of this process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Cohort analysis is the basis for forecasting audience, revenue, and other business metrics for your app&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cohort analysis is the basis for predicting the dynamics of the key metrics of your business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This metric divides users into cohorts based on the month they started using the product.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This means that if you build the forecast of a certain metric for a specific cohort of users (those who started using the product in month X) then you can easily project the forecast to the entire product. Thus, the forecast of the entire product can be simplified by scaling it down to a single cohort, which is easier to study. Since the process will be identical among cohorts, the results can then be scaled up to the entire product.&lt;br/&gt;
Forecasting the dynamics of the key metrics for a cohort of users is relatively easy because you can obtain it by analyzing historical data on older cohorts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that we’ve discussed the basic idea behind building metric forecasts for a product, we can get into the different aspects of the process:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Understanding the relation between the metrics (audience numbers, retention, revenue, etc.) of individual cohorts and the entire product&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Predicting the dynamics of revenue, audience and other metrics for a specific cohort of users&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Predicting the size of the cohorts that will come to the product in the future&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using Google Sheet templates to predict revenue, audience numbers, and other metrics&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Understanding the nuances, pitfalls and difficulties within the process of building the forecast.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Understanding the relation between the metrics (audience numbers, retention, revenue, etc.) of individual cohorts and the entire product&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consider the following product, let’s call it X.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;First month after launch&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You launch product X in January 2019. In January (the first month after the launch), 1,000 new users come to the product, and they spend $100.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In January, the app’s MAU will be 1,000 users, and the revenue will be $100, since at the moment, the product is entirely represented by one cohort of users who came in January.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Second month after launch&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In February 2019, another thousand new users join the product. They spend another $100. At the same time, 700 of the users who came in January are retained in February. These users spend $70.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, in February (the second month after the launch), the product’s MAU will be composed of the February cohort of active users (1,000 people) and what remains of the January cohort (700 retained users). That is, the audience will equal 1,000 + 700 = 1,700 users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Revenue in the second month will be equal to $100 + $70 = $170. It will also encompass the revenue of the two currently available cohorts of users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Third month after launch&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As in previous months, in March, we will add a third cohort of users (people who started using the product in March).The overall metrics will be the sum of metrics for the January, February and March cohorts at the end of March.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Month-N after launch&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we reach the end of month N after the launch, we will have N cohorts of users based on the month the users started using the product. The MAU for the entire product for month N will be equal to the sum of the audiences of each of the available cohorts in month N.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Why did we present the audience and revenue for each month as the sum of these metrics for individual cohorts?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The goal of this exercise was to show that the key metrics of your product in any month are directly determined by their corresponding values ​​in the cohorts of users, created based on the date the users joined the product.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This means that if we can predict the metric for all cohorts of users for a specific month, then we can easily get a forecast of this metric for the entire product (by summing the values ​​from all cohorts).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Predicting the dynamics of revenue, audience numbers and other metrics for a specific cohort of users&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Predicting the dynamics of revenue, audience, or any other metric for a particular cohort of users is relatively simple. To do this, you need to use the cohort’s historical data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Usually, you need to take the oldest relevant product cohorts in order to get their actual dynamics, and then project this dynamics to the new cohorts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, to predict a monthly active audience (MAU), you can take the following steps:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Take an old relevant cohort of users and calculate the MAU for this cohort by month. By “relevant” I mean that the cohort must reflect the current state of the product. In this context, a cohort that has existed before a major change to the product does not qualify as relevant.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Divide the resulting set of values ​​by the size of the cohort (the number of users in the cohort). At this step you will obtain the monthly retention rate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using monthly retention, you can easily predict what will be the audience of a particular cohort of users for any month. To do this, multiply the size of the cohort by the retention rate of the corresponding month.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you need to get the dynamics of the predicted metric for months that go beyond what you can get on the basis of the oldest relevant cohorts, you will need to make an assumption about the metric’s future dynamics:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For example, if the cohort’s audience has been steadily decreasing by 3% every month starting from some point in time, then you can assume that the same trend will continue in the upcoming months.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If the metric seems stable, you can assume that it won’t change in the coming months.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is no universal approach to this task. You will need to decide on a case-by-case basis.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s look at how this will work in the example of the app X that we examined earlier in this essay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;We take those who came in January 2019 as an old relevant cohort of users.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based on this cohort, we calculate the monthly retention rate of our product. To do this, we need to divide the audience number by the size of the cohort (1,000 users).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now we can make the MAU forecast of other cohorts for the month we are interested in. For example, the Month 4 MAU of the cohort that came in May 2019 will be equal to the number of users in this cohort multiplied by 4th month retention (1,000 * 70% = 700).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If we want to predict what the cohort’s MAU will be on Month 7, then we will need to assume what will happen with the monthly retention rate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In our case, the task is simple: retention has remained steady since Month 1, so we can assume that it will remain the same in the following months. As we collect more data in the future, we can modify the forecast if we observe any changes to the retention rate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The same procedure will help you to predict any other growth metric. Let’s see how this works on the product’s revenue forecast:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Take an old relevant cohort of users and calculate its month-by-month revenue.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Divide the resulting set of values ​​by the size of the cohort (the number of users in the cohort). At this point, you will receive an approximate revenue retention rate for a cohort of users.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using the metric above, you can easily predict what the revenue of a particular cohort of users will be for any month. To do this, you need to multiply the cohort size by the value of the metric calculated in the previous step for the corresponding month.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you need to obtain the dynamics of the predicted metric for months that go beyond what you can get on the basis of the oldest relevant cohorts, you will need to make an assumption about the future dynamics of the metric.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Forecasting metrics for a cohort of users is simple: first we get the data on how this metric changes for some old relevant cohort, and then we assume that other cohorts will have similar dynamics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Predicting the size of the future product’s cohorts&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last missing piece for creating a revenue or audience forecast is information about the size of future cohorts of users who will come to your product. That is, creating a forecast for the number of new users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is no universal way to predict the future number of new users, since the growth models of different products are fundamentally different.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To solve this problem, you will need to build a forecast of the number of new users for each of the distribution channels, based on the available levers and the limitations each of them has.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;How the metrics of user cohorts, selected based on the date users joined the product, make up the metrics of the entire product.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can find an example template for forecasting product revenue here [&lt;a href=""https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1atuXlLQSrjIHEoscPeL8un8pbCn-Z_S9YhEg3-qWig8/edit#gid=0""&gt;file&lt;/a&gt;].&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Creating a forecast works as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;

&lt;li&gt;We divided the result from the previous step by the number of users in the cohort (see row 12 in the file).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We made a forecast of the number of new users from October 2019 to the last month that we want to have the forecast for.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Based on the vale obtained in step 2, we built a revenue forecast for all product cohorts, created based on the month users started using the product.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The only thing left is to add the values ​​of the cohorts in the right way to get the revenue of the whole product in future months.&lt;/li&gt;

r/analytics,"Hey everyone,   
I have been tasked with getting Google Analytics up and running on my game stores website. Since we are an ecommerce website, I turned those functions on. I went through the Google Tag Manager set up and it's connected with Analytics as well. According to Tag Assistant both global site tags and GTM are running on my homepage. BUT I'm still getting the error in Google Analytics ""Missing Ecommerce Data"".   


As mentioned in the title, the website we use is a totally custom built page (on PHP) I believe and it uses a custom cart function as well. So a lot of the tutorials are showing how to implement code on Woocommerce or Shopify, but without any real developer knowledge on my end, I'm not too sure what to do.   


The snippet from GTM is on our website, but I don't believe there is any datalayer that I have set up. I have read about the ""Purchase Snippet"" that our dev should implement, but it's all Greek to me.   


So with all of that information out of the way, do you all have any idea how I can attack this problem and fix it? I am a simple dude without any background in coding so I am in way over my head when it comes to GTM set up.

Hi all!

I hate coding and am a product manager at Tractific. We are developing it to enable no-coders to analyze their data with the help of AI. The problem with other tools is they require 5-6 weeks of learning and also coding. (setting up .track functions, etc.)

What Tractific does is:

1. Integrates with a single line of code to your website
2. Finds the right metrics, analyzes the data, and creates graphs
3. Gives solutions like change the color of your features block or replace persona block with features block, etc. You can implement those solutions to increase your conversion rate. These solutions were basic examples but AI automatically gives them after analyzing it.

If you want to be a part of the private beta we have 20 more spots available and beta will be free to use for Redditors.

r/analytics,"Hi there,  


I hope this will help other candidates who might go through the same procedure.   
I went through an interview for Junior Analytics Advisor position, with a local (probably the best agency) in the country where I am.    


The interview went well, I would say, with a minor fuck up on my side. They asked me some questions, but used GA terms in their language, and I have used and learnt the tool in English, so I needed a bit time or gave a wrong answer (once) and once an answer which was not that full. Still they sent me a task which I had to complete and send it to them. It looks like that:  


Imagine this website has to be build from the ground up, and there is nothing done on it yet.

1.Which measures would you recommend the customer (the site owner) in terms of Web Analytics?  
2.Why are these measures important?  
3.What do you notice on this website as a whole?  


I will not post the site due to obvious reasons, and plus that it is not in English. This is E-Commerce Website, which focuses on gardening tools, like sprinkles, hoses, wooden houses, birds houses, seeds, plants, carports, everything for the home and garden basically. What I noticed is:  


1.They dont use GA, but another tool - Webtrends. Also no Facebook Pixel, which since they are in E-Commerce is a must, having in mind the recent deal between Facebook and Shopify. Always better to be prepared from early on, then to catch up later.

2.Not optimized for my resolution (screen zoom by default by laptop with 25% to 125%), so maybe deeper research on segment groups with this resolution and if there are higher bounce rates from the homepage or issues with the purchasing process. I cannot possibly go through all the pages, and maybe there is some behavioral pattern to be observed with users with such resolution, which is also the most popular in that country (found statistics, more than 14% use it). Also experiment with various OS, maybe MAC devices do not zoom in by default. It looked well on my other screen and phone.  


3.Homepage too heavy (too many pictures, categories, etc.) to navigate and differentiate through the various categories, I spent a lot of time (20-30) sec to figure out which one is a product category and what is a blog post, which gives advice on how to plan your trees correctly or how to select the best car port. I suggested using a price label on every category (f.e. starting at 99USD), this would be easier for the eyes, especially having in mind that the customer base is likely older (&gt;45 maybe even &gt;50). This demographic info is easy available through their databases and GA.  


4.HeatMap of customers to see how far they scroll down, how much time do they spend there (to see if these categories and stuff are really that hard to understand), maybe they flock to the search function immediately?  


4.Search bar is in the middle, while it ideally should be on the right or left. It still could expand through the middle, since it shows images and categories (very good search function if I have to be honest). I suggested looking through the searches and establishing new categories or top searches for the season / week, if there is enough data to figure out a trend.  


5.Where do the customers come from, is there a difference in the Landing Pages? I want to look at product pages with have higher exit / bounce rate and compare them to similar products, which convert better. Maybe the one has too much / too little info, and this can be optimized when building the new website.  


6.What is the traffic from pictures? Their pictures were randomly named f.e. asiud1123asx.jpg and no alt-tag. I suggested naming them with a brand and some specifications. f.e. when it is electrical equipment its power (15W), and if it is a hose, its length and color, just to get an idea.  


7.Purchasing process - is there a step which takes a little bit too long? I experimented with a test order, everything went smoothly, maybe the new web page should pop up with Street suggestions, so people do not mess them up (some are complicated). This would result in easier shipping and less shipment mistakes, even though they would have been caused up by the customer.  


8. Too big icons for payment and shipping methods, they looked like separate categories.  


9.Some E-Commerce statistics for the (converting) customers - is there a difference between landing pages for those who convert or not, how much time did they spent on the website, how many searches did they perform? Maybe customers who find their desired product with two searches are more likely to order than those who performed 3 searches and up.  Maybe converting customers are landing on ""more simplified"" webpages. Here I again have the homepage in mind, which is very hard to use and understand.

Last  week I had a post “Interested in connecting with Data job recruiters”  and a post about looking for a junior to mid-level SQL data analyst.   Included in the search would also be finding  a non-profit organization as well to begin the data analyst journey  with. I have heard that this is a great way to gain some experience  while helping at the same time.   

Does anyone have suggestions on the best way to find a non-profit to approach do data support for? 

Is there a common type of problem or pain point non-profits have, that data support could help with?  

I  do have experience both in my current role and the one prior with ""work  from home"" / remote, and have experience using GoToMeeting, RingCentral, Teams Meeting, Slack, Skype and Zoom. 

Started learning Oracle &amp; PostgreSQL about 2 years ago. 

PowerBI including DAX about 2 years ago. 

Python and R language 4-5 years ago. 

And, I am currently working on an advanced exercise for DAX. 

Ultimately,  I want to work in a remote arrangement, but it doesn't have to be in  this first position and I am willing to relocate to anywhere. I am  currently in the SF bay area. 

If there is a better sub/r for this question, please let me know.

\- No privacy popup box

\- Smaller Code (quicker landing page load times)

\- Open Source

\- Simple stats. It might sound counter-intuitive, but Google Analytics tracks about 300 data points on every site user, which is an overkill. We have noticed that we have used about 12 out of those 300.

\- Ability to video record sessions. This is arguably one of the most important tools, as we just realized that we had a popup box on our landing page that was covering the ""Signup"" button on some Andoid phones. After replaying the session replays, we have realized that our conversions have gone up from 13% to about 20% on mobile phones. That is huge.

\- Heatmaps. We can see the hottest zones on any page. This is especially great when we perform A/B tests with two different landing pages.

\- There aren't many cons, but one of them is not an extremely precise tracking of users with PrivateAnalytix vs Google Analytics. Let me explain, Google uses cookies to track users (this is what mainly creates privacy issues). 

PrivateAnalytix doesn't use cookies and doesn't collect any user identifiable information. So if the same person from the same IP visits the site, PrivateAnalytics will think count this as 2 visits. 

Hope this helps you guys. I was fed up with privacy concerns of Google Analytics. Though it is free, they sell user information to their partners. PrivateAnalytix doesn't store PII, we own the data, we can do session replays and heatmaps.

r/analytics,"I'll elaborate a bit - so - we have an issue for our ecomm site where our 'forgot password' email 'steals' last click attribution from our other channels. e.g - someone clicks from a facebook ad, goes to sign in, forgets their password, resets, then clicks through the email they received to reset their password. This means the original last click source (in this case, Facebook) gets overridden to Email.

The domain referral exclusion list could work, but would then block all other attribution from whatever domain the email click throughs come from.

So in short ... Is there a way to configure GA to 'ignore' a click through from a specific UTM?

To illustrate..

**Current attribution:**

* Google - first click
* Facebook - 2nd click
* Email forgot password link - 3rd and last click --&gt; Sale goes to 'Email'

**Desired attribution:**

* Google - first click
* Facebook - 2nd click
* Email forgot password link - GA configured to ignore the UTM and treat the prior click 'Social' as the last click attribution source.
* \--&gt; Sale goes to 'Facebook'

This sounds niche but is quite a pain - 'forgot password' makes up about 3% of our sales.

Any help or suggestions hugely appreciated.

r/analytics,"Hey guys,

I'm working for a small start up as the head of marketing performance. We're an entertainment app publisher and facing volatile performance right now. 

Relevant for context, before I start going into my initial question:
our app is tied with in-app credits, they're needed to use the key feature (entertainment) of the app. Every action needs 20 credits, the user get's 5 free credits per day for the login, 60 for the start, and we do offer a slot machine, with a free game per day, to win additional credits (first game of the day will most likely be a win of 3 credits). 

Unfortunately Google kicked us out of the Google Playstore, and we cut off the slot-feature, with our latest update. iOS users can still use the feature but new acquired android users (and older cohorts who update the app) can't use the feature now.

We do not have a bi-manager or data analyst in the team, so I'm trying to figure out things by myself. I was thinking about drawing correlation between the whole free credit contingent per day and the free credits won with the slot machine per day. If that's significant, I would try to draw correlation between the free credits contingent per day and daily revenue. Does that make sense or how would you approach this situation to measure if the feature had/has an impact on performance/revenue.

**Method 1:** If I use Google Optimize, I am able to change the price a user sees.

Original: Price on page = $10

Variant 1: Price on page = $20

*Problem with Method 1:* However, even if I edit the page to show $20 when a user clicks Add to Cart, they would still add the $10 version of the product. Clearly, this is not ideal for testing purposes since I want to see how many users actually checked out at the $20 price point.

**Method 2:** Have different landing pages that show different products. Using my e-commerce plugin (WooCommerce), I can then add different prices for the same product (ie. add the same product twice just that they have different prices). This way the price a user sees is actually what is added to their cart.

r/analytics,"Hi everyone,

Before I start, a little bit of context :)

Age: 29

Country: Spain

&amp;#x200B;

Academic Background: BSc in Economics by the Pompeu Fabra University in Barcelona (Well positioned university in Europe with a strong Math/Stats program) and a Master Degree in Marketing Management (Once I finish my studies I realized that I was more interested in business and strategy rather than Economics)

&amp;#x200B;

Professional Background: B2B Product Marketing Manager in a Tech Multinacional Company. Full-time job.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm currently aware about how the world if changing and I'm realizing that a more queantitative set of skills will make my profile more competitive in the labor market even if I'm not into a pure technical career. I'm currently interested in Marketing, Business and Strategy, and if it's possible, I'd like to keep my career focus in these fields, however, everytime I go to Linkedin and other Job Websites I see that having such sets of skills will we quite useful for futures jobs, even though these aren't BI/BA specific jobs, but it's always useful an analytical profile with a complete set of skills focused on SQL, R, Python, Excel...

&amp;#x200B;

At first I thought on starting in getting BA/BI skills by myself such as learning SQL, R (did some back in my university days) and Python. Then go deeper on Excel and some Data Visualization programs like Power BI or Tableau. Go directly for the skills I need. However, in these days I though that perhaps getting a second BSc in CS will be ever more helpful in the long term even though I'm not interested in technical jobs, but more business and strategic ones.

&amp;#x200B;

The thing about this is that I'm not a 18-20 year old guy anymore with no responsabilities. If I start to study CS I will have to do it while I'm in my full-time current job. In Spain BS and BA have a duration of 4 years, which means that if I'm get into this I will take at least 6-8 years to get the Bachelor taking into account that I work 8 hours minimum every day and it takes about 2 hours to travel home from work and vice versa. I don't think that I will have enough time to go a course by yeear. I wouldn't hesitate to do that if I was a bit younger, and even if a had a part-time job like working in a pizza corner or something like that, but right now if I take this decision I need to be aware that I will finish my degree with 35-37 years the BS in CS. However, If I do it I will have a very complete profile.

&amp;#x200B;

I think the point at which a decision is good is when the benefit / cost ratio is high. It is evident that the cost of taking this decision for me according to my circumstances will be high (not so much economically) in terms of time, effort, sacrificing free time to go to the gym, staying with my girlfriend, and other hobbies taking into account that I'll have to work in a serious full-time job while I'm studying a STEM Degree. The question is, will the benefit be as much or higher than the cost based on the fact that my interest continues to continue working in Marketing, Strategy and Business, but I would simply like to have a more technical profile?

&amp;#x200B;

Should I focus on getting profisiency in a set of skills that the labor market is demanding like the ones I previously mentioned or will be better in the long run getting a Bachelor in CS even though I'm still interested in Business and Marketing?",t2_ujszb,Thinking of getting a BSc in CS.

At the end, the top items would be those that were in the top quartile for every variable, followed by the items that were in the top quartile for 3 variables but in the 2nd quartile for the last variable and so on...

r/analytics,"Hi all,

Last time I posted here I was looking for help with getting customer quality data from WooCommerce blended with the source they came in from, for a subscription-model client. What I needed to do was see how the ad group/campaign that converted a user affected their lifetime revenue, retention rate, and so on, so we can make better-informed decisions about the quality of each ad campaign.

&amp;#x200B;

To do that, I used the transaction ID within Google Ads as the join key to tie to the Trial ID within WooCommerce and visualized it within Data Studio. That's how we figured out the Google Ads data, and now I can browse number of cancellations, renewals, cancellation rates, average number of renewals, e.t.c on an individual ad level.

&amp;#x200B;

Now I'm trying to figure out a way to do the same for Facebook/Instagram Ads. Unfortunately, the same set up won't work, because some of the metrics I'd need to get data on an ad set/individual ad level aren't allowed in blended data by Google.

r/analytics,"Hi guys,

  
I am having Interview for Junior Digital Analytics Consultant position at a rather prestigious agency where I am based. The job description is:  


1. At the beginning support and later independent handling of digital analytics projects as consultant and key account manager for our customers
2. Conception of digital analytics solutions and strategies as well as ongoing support and improvement for our customers
3. Website traffic and campaign analysis and recommendations for our customers
4. Working close with out  Programmatic Marketing Team 
5. Research and ideas presentation
6. GAIQ would be lovely, but not a necessity  - **I have it GAIQ + some Google Ads certification**
7. Knowledge of Data Analysis with Excel -  **Not proficient, have done it in the past, but I can manage everything very fast through research**
8. Visualization with Tableau / Data Studio would be nice, but not necessity - **I have little experience with Tableau, can catch up rather quickly.**
9. Digital Marketing Know-How - **I am pretty good here**

&amp;#x200B;

I would be happy to get some tips regarding the interview. Now, have in mind that the HR loves me due to my past experience, so I have a plus here. I have GAIQ, but the thing is, I have not practiced it a lot - just like a language, I need a bit to master it, and once I start playing with it, I am confident I will get under its skin. I am usually quite modest about myself, but really, Digital Native is underestimation.  


The first interview will be with the HR, I guess there will be second one with a guy leading the Digital Analytics team, where I might need to show a skill or two of mine. It will likely be in a week from now.

I really do not know what the tasks look like in such a position. Is it like ""**Here is website A, take a look at GA and tell us what inefficiencies are to be found"", or being a Junior, I would be getting exact tasks, given by a higher ranked employee?** Input from people working in the field will be appreciated. Am I expected to start and be perfect from the very beginning? Knowing myself handling other tools, If I am doing this full time I should be at very advanced level in two to maximum three weeks.

&amp;#x200B;

**Can you guys think of any questions that might come during the interview?**

 There are other SEO / SEM Junior positions available too. I guess since I am favored by the HR she will try to find me a place, realizing my potential, he will want to ""help me"", if he thinks I am better fit there.  Is Junior in that field considered ""Trainee"" where you have a month or two of onboarding period before being on your own? I am kind of lost, and while all these answers will likely be answered during the first interview with the HR, I would like to hear some inputs.

Scenario: Had to merge and de-duplicate 5 excel tables from different providers. Data is very similar but each provider uses their own dictionaries (drug1, drug001, drg-01). As an excel user with little-to-no vba experience, i dont have other options than checking data manually and it is very time consuming.

I wanted to automate the process a bit and the best solution i came up with was to setting up this process in mySQL, in order to 1) import the excel tables 2) pattern/fuzzy match the data 3) Present an already de-duplicated output with a data provider count, in order to quantify how many times a drug is indexed across databases (kinda like a quality check)

I'd be willing to learn mySQL and do it myself but i realize its a lot of work (took me hours just to import 2 out of 5 tables using the mysql wizard in excel) so am considering hiring someone to get the job done. My idea is to build a cross-checking and reporting system to reduce analysis lead times from days to hours.

r/analytics,"Hey all,

Hoping for some sound advice as I realise I might be in a terrible situation (or not - hoping you can assess it) in my career.

For the past 5 years I've been working with Qlik products and became somewhat of an expert at it.

The problem is, I've become so much of an expert that I can't confidently say I am good at anything else (e.g. other products such as Tableau, PowerBI etc) because I haven't delivered work in any other tools in the past 5 years.

In one way it's great because I am usually at the top when it comes to work projects around Qlik. But the down side is I have placed all of my eggs in one basket. The COVID19 situation has made me realise how exposed I am if there is no work besides this product.

So how do I dig myself out of this and diversify? Any advice?

Skills wise:

- Working in Business Intelligence.

- Expert level understanding of how to script in Qlik for data modelling and design.

- SQL (SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, CREATE, COMMENT)

- Dimensional modelling concepts (e.g. Star Schema, Snowflake) having modelled this way for Qlik data models.

- Server configuration (e.g. clustering and multi-node server deployments for Qlik)

- Training and coaching juniors in the above for less experienced developers.

- Presenting, documentation (data specs, diagrams, training documentation, slide-decks, storytelling using data) etc.

- Consulting clients on the product, making performance better etc.

- Visualisation design best practices

- Trained many hundreds of people so can understand nuances of how people learn.

Overall I have 10 years experience in tech.

I am feeling very nervous about my situation and don't know what to do next so would appreciate any sound advice you may have.

Due to my unemployment I've been using LinkedIn and have noticed how so many people are so expert in so many products. I don't know if they are exaggerating or if it's genuinely the case so maybe this is also playing into my in-adequateness lately.

My aspiration is to become maybe less-hands on and go into roles which require a mixture of technical skills, working with people, presentations, and has elements of marketing. I believe my experience over the 10 years covers many of this, the problem is I am a specialist in a propertary software maybe?

For now I am happy to continue working on technical roles to keep bring food on the table for my family but I am acutely aware of the dangers of continuing down my current path.

To try and fight this, during my unemployment I have been learning on my own:

- Microsoft Power BI

- Cloud data warehousing tools.

- Python programming.

- Reading in general.

r/analytics," 

I want to test for difference in average time per action between 2 groups. I have data on total time per day and total actions per day over a period of days, ex: time = 120 and actions = 45 for Jan 1.

I was wondering what is the best way to average and compare the data. I was just finding the average( tn/an) (example below) for the range of dates and comparing between the groups using a t test with equal variance. However I think another way to calculate average is more appropriate to find the average time per action for each group. My example of why:

&amp;#x200B;

|Day|Time|Action|
|:-|:-|:-|
|1|5|1|
|2|5|5|

The original average I did: average is (5/1+5/5) / 2 = 3 time per action.

However I think I should be using actions as the denominator since I want time per action. So it would be: (5+5) / (1+5) = 10/6 or 1.67 time per action. I feel like the second method is the best way to find the average time per action. However, I want to compare these 2 groups using a test test and I am unsure how to do that and what N should be to accurately test for significant difference, since my data is collected by day and not by individual action.

Any advice is welcome as is tips on how to do this is Excel or stata.

&lt;p&gt;However I think I should be using actions as the denominator since I want time per action. So it would be: (5+5) / (1+5) = 10/6 or 1.67 time per action. I feel like the second method is the best way to find the average time per action. However, I want to compare these 2 groups using a test test and I am unsure how to do that and what N should be to accurately test for significant difference, since my data is collected by day and not by individual action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any advice is welcome as is tips on how to do this is Excel or stata. Sorry if this is a dumb question lol.&lt;/p&gt;

Long story short, I was lucky enough in having the opportunity to take a foreign masters degree on a full scholarship, but then the quarantine happened. I'm eyeing a program called 'Master in City Analytics' which accepts candidates from various backgrounds (built env, CS, econ, law, business, etc) so I'm hoping to get qualified. Things like geocoding, big data viz, Python, GIS, making dashboards, even use of VR, and lots of other tech stuff will be taught. I'm learning programming on/off for the past 2 years or so but my undergrad and work experience are in architecture. The way I see it, I view this as a subset or more specialized form of Urban/City Planning which I'm no stranger to.

I might be able to have the same scholarship opportunity again in 2021 depending on the Corona situation getting better. While it's a great opportunity (fully paid tuition with stipend, I can also work part-time while studying), it's still a 1.5 to 2-year commitment plus I'm required to return home and contribute to my home country, which I fully intend to do. My choice of program will be a make or break scenario that will affect my life for the next 5+ years, which kinda scares me.

I started reading about creating a piece of code I could insert into my target URLs to identify them as part of my campaign, but all my reading seems to be about external campaigns, whereas my review is 100% internal.

r/analytics,"Hi,

Thanks for accepting me in the subreddit!

So here's my question - I made a HTML game (in Twine engine) and added GA code to be able to track the number of people playing. The game is online, and the tracking works very well. The problem starts with how I distribute the game. Basically - there is one central place where I host it, but for marketing purposes I encourage people to put it on their servers too, or other websites with games of similar type. I just want the game to be available on as many places as possible, as my main source of income is Patreon.

So basically here's the main issue - the game is played on multiple different domains and all the domains share the same analytics, and it's hard to differentiate the traffic of my main domain, from the traffic of other domains.

What makes things even more complicated - is that in the game there's a check for new version, that contacts my main domain, and if the new version is available on my main domain - it displays a button in the game that redirects player to my main domain where he can play the newest version. And this is an important feature, because I want people play the game on my main domain as much as possible, because at some point I want to add ads. But this makes the thing even more complicated, because I don't know whether someone started playing on the other host, and than maybe moved to the main host, or is he playing on the other host the entire time? 

So here's my questions:

1. How do I check the traffic ONLY on my main domain, excluding those other domains?
2. How do I check the traffic ONLY on one of the other domains?
3. How do I check which of the other domains has most redirection to my central domain?

Hello Experts,

&amp;#x200B;

I am new to OBIEE tool , hence kindly bear with me if my query is basic in nature.

I have 2 RPD files, a.rpd and b.rpd. I need to switch between these 2 RPDs on same server and through same OBIEE tool.

Do I need to deploy both RPD on server to switch between these two through same OBIEE tool?

&amp;#x200B;

As per my own attempt, I can open both RPD file through Administration (obiee tool) : File --&gt; Open--&gt;Offline and without any deployment.

&amp;#x200B;

Is it mandatory to deploy both RPD at server to open it on line?

&amp;#x200B;

&lt;p&gt;Hello Experts,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am new to OBIEE tool , hence kindly bear with me if my query is basic in nature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have 2 RPD files, a.rpd and b.rpd. I need to switch between these 2 RPDs on same server and through same OBIEE tool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do I need to deploy both RPD on server to switch between these two through same OBIEE tool?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As per my own attempt, I can open both RPD file through Administration (obiee tool) : File --&amp;gt; Open--&amp;gt;Offline and without any deployment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is it mandatory to deploy both RPD at server to open it on line?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

r/analytics,"*Had posted this in* r/BusinessIntelligence *as well*

Apologies for long post - my first one! A bit of context, I recently quit my full time job. I was in accounting/audit (Canadian CA, CPA) and had moved into a more consulting/advisory role, with a total of about 7 years of experience at a B4 in Canada and Australia. I'm trying to pivot into the data science world and after some research (plus given my past experience as well as interest), I'd like to explore more of the data analyst/business intelligence route. I spent the last couple of weeks learning Python (finished Dr. Chuck's Python for Everybody Specialization on Coursera) and am planning to learn the basics of SQL and Tableau next. In terms of interest, base on the little exposure I have so far, I probably will have a bit more interest in Tableau (generally have enjoyed playing around with the visual aesthetics in PowerPoint presentations and telling stories from a visual perspective - don't think it's something I am particularly good at but am definitely looking to upscale this part the most).

Still working on defining what it is exactly that I am working towards but this is kind of the start. Would like to be in a position where I could use data to drive decision-making in more of an operations standpoint and away from finance/reporting but understand that finance/reporting is where I may need to start off. I also understand that I will most likely need to drop a level or two down from a manager position.

***My questions:***

1. What is the best/most efficient way to upscale? For example, I now know at a basic level how Python works but I don't think I can independently scrape a page. Should I take a more intermediate course or try to do a simple project to start with?
2. For SQL and Tableau, I'd previously taken a few beginner courses online but will probably need a bit more practice. Am planning on taking advantage Tableau's 90 day free learning. Similar to Q1, do I do a bit more self learning or start a small project?
3. How technical do I really need to get if I want to go more of the data analyst/business intelligence route? I know I won't be anywhere as experienced as the technical DS but figured it'd be good to have a basic understanding and working knowledge. I know that my strengths to move into this field will really be the soft skills and business acumen - figured that I would need to build up some technical capabilities.
4. Would it be useful to also brush up on stats and calculus? I've only done the basic Business Stats and Calc courses in university.
5. Is there even a need for this type of role? Any recommendations of what type of jobs there are? So far I've seen Data Analytics consulting groups within the B4 and other marketing/consulting agencies.
6. Any other advice is also greatly appreciated!

r/analytics,"Hi all. I've got a report to create within Data Studio and there's a column I need that I don't know how to get.

&amp;#x200B;

**Background**

Trying to see if acquisition method (like keyword, or UTMs) affects the quality of a customer: lifetime value, retention rate, e.t.c.

**Data**

I'm using a CSV from WooCommerce with the customer records and a direct import from Google Analytics. This data has to be joined by the Transaction ID in GA/Trial ID in WooCommerce to get it to blend in Google Data Studio.

&amp;#x200B;

**Issue** 

So, this report has 'Keyword' as the main dimension in a standard table. I need two more columns to connect to this: one with an aggregate of the ACTIVE subscriptions, and another with the aggregate of the CANCELLED subscriptions.

This data comes from a 'subscription status' column, which contains one of two values: 'cancelled' or 'active.' 

What I'm trying to do, and what I think I should be able to do, is use REGEX in a calculated metric column to count each 'cancelled' value and each 'active' value and express them as an aggregate: something like​

CASE     

WHEN REGEXP\_MATCH(Subscription Status, "".\*(cancelled).\*"")  THEN 1    

ELSE 0

END

The only problem is that this gets listed as a 'valid' formula before I hit apply, but then throws up system errors every single time. I've tried a number of variations on the above but hit the same problem no matter what I try.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I have User-ID feature enabled in my GA with session unification ON.

Inside my app when user logging I push userId to dataLayer and then I publish the custom event.

Inside my ""All View"" I can see 2 users witch is good (since merging still did not happen) and inside my User-ID View I can see just user with set User-ID

Now, the thing I noticed is that when the custom event that is published from the client is showing in both Non-UserID and UserID Views.

But when I publish Custom Event from the Server through the API (this needs to be done from server), With only passing User-ID That event is only showing inside User-ID View.

My question is is this expected? Or should I publish the Event from the Client directly through API with User-Id, or Session Unification will do the job and I'll only have 1 event showing instead of two, meaning that it will figure out that Event is actually associated to that specific User?

r/analytics,"Hello guys,

I have a very frustrating FB pixel issue here, it's quite specific and  you would make my week by helping.

I'm using woocommerce and have installed the FB pixel initially only manual (in the header), then with a plugin(pixelyoursite and pixel caffeine).

The facebook pixel fired perfectly when I tested it, but...

Here are the issues:

1.In the ads reporting, I had more unique initiate checkouts than unique add to carts (check photo).

2.I lose about 20% of the clicks to the site ( Link clicks vs Page views). And the site loads in about 3-4 sec (I've seen other sites losing less than 5% with higher speeds).

3.I tested the pixel events again, but with slow 3g speed (from chrome dev tools) and it seems that the events are firing twice.

r/analytics,"Hi guys, I'm a student and have a big analytics project as part of a final. I'm very good at modeling and post-processing but am a bit weak at pre-processing. In order to make sure everything goes smoothly I'd like to make sure I'm correctly identifying datasets attributes as numerical vs categorical.

[Dataset (Google Drive)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ag3lAM-KbNjtwlXuMm8l6OkRwPRxI-lo/view?usp=sharing)

I've highlighted the attributes as per the classification I believe they are:

Green = Numerical

Yellow = Categorical

Red = Output

&amp;#x200B;

**My big questions regard attributes Q6, Q7, Q35, Q36, &amp; Q37.**

**Q6**:  I believe this is **categorical** because hours seems to be on a scale of \[less than 1 hour, 1 hour, 2 hours, 3 hours, 4 hours, 5 hours, more than 6 hours\]. If not for the scale (finite options for survey it would be continuous)

**Q7**: I believe this to be **categorical**.  While it's a number, it may be categorical as it seems to be on a finite scale of \[0,1, 2, 3, 4+\] 

**Q35, Q36, &amp; Q37**: I don't understand these attributes as they're responses to ""Do you have any kids? - Yes/No \_\_\_"". On the surface they appear binary (Yes, No) and thus **categorical** but the max values for these attributes are 6, 7 &amp; 9 respectively perhaps indicating they are **continuous**. Perhaps you can infer what this really means. Perhaps it means for example ""Yes I have 6 kids that ride mountain bikes"". 

What really throws me is when a subject indicates they have kids by entering a value for Q35 and/or Q36, but simultaneously indicates they don't have kids by entering in a value for Q37. As of right now I'm going with **continuous** (numerical).

&amp;#x200B;

Even a guess will really help me out.

PREFACE:
Consumerism is reaching a critical halt with the pandemic this therefore presents a problem for us aspiring brand entrepreneurs. The fashion industry is one of the markets suffering the most from this economical shift. With the following passage I will address two phenomena that inherently are affecting the fashion world.The first is a social economical stand point and the second is the “drake culture vulture” circumstance.


-A RIFT HAS BEEN CREATED ONCE AGAIN-

High end fashion and regular fast fashion are gonna have an enormous rift between these two industries.Why? The masses can’t spend their income on “extra things”.In 2018 consumerism was at an all time high ,that which separated high end with low end was non-existent.Accessible to all masses ,the rich were rich so who gives a fuck ,the middle class was wealthy and the lower class was able to be indebted cause of low interest rates in the majority of countries . Those interest rates are gonna sky rocket in these next months ,why ?

The banks need money cause they’re too busy giving loans to the majority businesses cause If you haven’t noticed ,there’s no consumerism in non dispensable products.The companies that pertain to these niches they’re all f-ing broke.Covid is bad but it’s triggered a bigger flu that could ever be contained.

Pretty much “An immense rift between high end fashion and low end fashion has segregated them once again”

-Formal informality potentially will be the next wave-

Taking into consideration the aforementioned.This now allows distinguished designers too expend more on lavish materials.Cause now their market shall be directed towards the high end buyers.More expensive materials , higher end cloths ,cuts that suit the wealthy(formality).The fashion market hasn’t been able to shift away from the typical graphic tees that have dominated the market since the 2010’s that deter from unique cut and sews.Perhaps this could be seen as a necessary evolution leaving behind the standard of mediocrity that has saturated the fashion world.

Ok now so the second is Drake “The culture vulture” it’s pretty apparent that celeb pop culture has a big influence on what we see as “desirable”. Drake Champaign papi ,this dude whatever he touches turns to gold now ,why cause he’s drake ! You cannot lie that he as an individual has had an influence on pop culture ,which ultimately translates into our daily lives as a society.

Drake up until recently has changed his market direction towards the uk grime scene ,he’s with other dudes now you can say which then transforms drake. The uk is becoming a power house for both music innovation and fashion innovation where high end brands like: 
Montcler,Heliot Emil , Aylx,Acw and the biggest one Stone Island seem to dominate this scene .Drake has notability been seen in his most previous music videos ONLY SPORTING THESE NEW UP AND COMING BRANDS , on his new song he mentions Alyx in his CHORUS ,now everybody is gonna be saying alyx and that’s Promotion bub! 
This will only help these brands become the center point of fashion trendsetters.

In conclusion I’d like to state that; with the nuances of technology and easily accessible softwares , globalization of markets.In our current era never has it been more easy to become an entrepreneur. The latter is that , the standard consequently must be raised to avoid saturation, only allowing the truly innovative a platform so they may define this generations art of expression .This may sound Darwinistic but I feel that the same way nature disposes of the weak so should this market aspire to accomplish.

Everybody may have something to convey but not everything can be felt due to its disillusive intention.Seek within but also seek outside ones-self to determine what value you may offer.

I have am trying to blend the data of 2 different data sources, one is data from Facebook ads in a google sheet, and the other is data from Google ads via Google Data Studio's direct connector.

The 2 platforms have slightly different naming for example the Google ads metric is called cost while the Facebook ads metric is called amount spent. There are also other examples like clicks vs link clicks and conversions vs custom conversions etc.

I am supposed to show the media spend data in a bar chart graph to compare media spend weekly, but after blending the data, I see 2 labels in the legend, one says cost and one says amount spent.

I used ""day"" as a join key. But how do i change it such that the legend labels are Google Ads Spend and Facebook ads Spend instead?

r/analytics,"Hi everyone, here's a quick background on my situation: I recently graduated in December with a BS in Finance and minors in Comp Sci and Business Analytics. I've been working 2 internships the past year or so, both of which have mostly involved Power BI, SQL, and Excel doing a lot of ad hoc reporting, writing queries/making views, and some forecasting. 

One of the companies I had been working with was pretty inconsistent work, working on projects remotely every couple months when they need me. They had been paying me $17.50/hr (1099 so closer to $15/hr) as a student/intern, which was fine at the time, but I feel like now that I have a year or so of experience and a degree under my belt that my time is worth significantly more.

My boss from said company hit me up yesterday for the first time in a few months and said he had a new Power BI project for me which I fully intend on accepting but I want to ask for a raise and I'm hoping someone can give me advice:

1. How do I word this request? Do I need to explain myself and talk about how I'm more experienced/efficient, how I feel like my time is worth more than $17.50 an hour at this point? I think he knows how cheap that is for analytics work but I also still consider myself somewhat of a beginner. 
2. How much should I ask for? I was thinking around $25-30/hr but I'm not sure if that's too big of a jump from my previous rate of 17.50. I also am currently very desperate for any work I can get so I would hate for him to be like ""Well for $30/hr I can just do it myself""

\- Being a female, am I less likely to be taken seriously in the industry?

I'm happy to share with you all some of the questions that I hope to get answered. The majority of these questions are fairly general and are being posed in order to help me develop a better understanding of the industry/career.

How do the projects you work on align with your own personal/career goals?

How large are the data sets that you work with and process?

How are you using these analytics to improve some aspect of operation or life?

What things does a data scientist need the most?

Is there a way to do that? I tried doing it via Behavior -&gt; Events -&gt; Top Events -&gt; Click on outbound link and so on. I can see all outbound links except the embedded posts.It seems as though the HTML inline frame is not visible to the tag manager.

Does someone have an idea how to do it?

I've been using Tableau for a few years now and I haven't been successful in creating reports mixing multiple data sources.

The problem here is when you do bring in multiple separate data sources, how can you display different fields in a table view. (Let's assume the data models and sources are set up correctly).These are two completely different sources and quite large, so it is not ideal to bring them in together as one data source.

I know Tableau has data blending but the thing is if a source uses different filters than the other source, how can i display fields from the second source cleanly without affecting the first source. I've been successful at times using a mix of LODs and different filters but it's not always effective.

Having that said (this isn't a tableau question), but my company has been trying out different BI tools such as Looker, SiSense, etc. and with their POCs, I haven't had any luck figuring if there's a clean way in showing data (tabular view) with multiple sources.

* Remember that running tests during a crisis doesn’t necessarily negate the results.
* If you *have* to launch a new product, feature or campaign without doing any testing, consider launching it to 95% of users and use the remaining 5% as a holdout group.
* Time is of the essence. We’re seeing a combination of tactics being used to speed up iteration: testing micro-step conversions, using holdout groups, planning for backtests or simply launching with a pre- and post-analysis.

&lt;p&gt;With that said, most of my background comes from being an IT Recruiter, hiring software developers for the most part. I thought it would be an easy transition but have been surprised by how difficult it  has been for me to truly understand the role. I&amp;#39;m having trouble visualizing what it even means to manage a full implementation process when I am describing the role to candidates, or the general questions I can ask candidates to understand their day-to-day and gauge their skill-levels. I have watched youtube videos and done plenty of google searches to understand the very basics but looking for knowledge or resources that can help with:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;what are the basics that candidates in these roles want to know about in regards to the day-to-day of the role, the complexity of the role, the skill-level required of the role (outside of &amp;quot;2 years of experience with GA&amp;quot;). &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;what are the basic questions I can ask for a fluid conversation with candidates to learn about their background and dig deeper into the intricacies of their previous roles? For example, with software developers, I would ask questions about whether or not they are writing code from scratch,  understanding their strengths with front-end vs back-end development, the languages and frameworks they&amp;#39;ve used, understanding what it was they were developing, the stages of the SDLC they have worked in, who is responsible for testing code, deploying it, etc. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What can I ask that helps me identify and differentiate junior candidates from mid-level to senior candidates? What separates average from the highly skilled in these roles? How can I better understand the difference between a general GA person and someone handling the &amp;quot;full implementation&amp;quot; process?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How can I work with our analytics team to explicitly identify exactly what we are looking for and the questions our more technical/hands-on interviewing team could be asking candidates? Something that is more sophisticated to prep the interviewing team. Right now, the team doesn&amp;#39;t have a standard set of questions they are using but instead are just told to &amp;quot;dig into&amp;quot; their GA knowledge and their understanding of tagging, tacking, platform integrations, etc.&lt;/li&gt;

I've gotten a task from my supervisor at my internship to try and track products we have on sale.

r/analytics,"**Overview:**

So the data is from a lending company who's main product provides loans to emerging markets, and the customer base consists of individuals who use the product regularly to grow their business, while others use it for more on demand purposes. My goal is to create and define a new metric called ""Active Customers"". I am performing my analysis using RStudio.

**Some of the deliverables that I want to pursue include:** 

\- Defining what an active customer is, and the cutoff threshold for how long they should be considered an active customer.

\- Summarize ""Customer Retention Rates"" based on the newly defined Active Customer definition. 

**Data:**

All the data is customer loan history from customers who signed up in Q1 of 2017. I've already performed the data cleansing and have a little over 1.3 million observations and reduced my dataset to 10 variables. Each row of data represents a loan application and their are some customers with multiple applications. Some of my left over variables are: 

\- Date of application

\- Approval decision of application

\- Disbursement date

\- Loan amount disbursed

\- Number of repayments made

\- Due date

\- Loan outstanding

So, how do I go about defining what an active customer is using the information above? Should I perform some kind of analysis or just make a general assumption/definition based on general business standards. I personally think that If a customer has applied for more than one loan and/or currently has a loan outstanding, then they are considered an ""Active Customer""; and, if the customer has no outstanding loans or has only one application that was reject then they are not considered ""Active"".

I'm not very proficient with GA yet (we mainly use other toolsets), but I recall when GA was first becoming a thing, there were a lot of discussions regarding how if you're not paying for what is today called 360, Google would take samples of your data to use for their own purposes, marketing or otherwise. Is this still true to this day? Is that the cost of doing business if you use GA but don't pay for 360?

There are all these lovely EULAs and whatnot, but as usual they're about as impenetrable as a bank vault to the layman. I understand they don't collect identifiable information (email, names, etc.), but to what extent can I really call my data ""secure"" if I use GA?

r/analytics,"Hi there,

&amp;#x200B;

I want to clarify the **process of how a dataLayer works with GTM**. As we're going to be dataLayer event driven going forwards. Could someone  kindly give me some pointers whether the below is correct or not please:

&amp;#x200B;

1) developer creates the keys value pairs in the abstract model repository that lives in the backend of a page, and these keys and values are based on the analytics requirement i.e. data mapping 

&amp;#x200B;

2) once these values and keys are populated for the necessary page (s), a dataLayer.  push script is written and added below the GTM container tag on the page. For example:

 

window.dataLayer = window.dataLayer || \[\];

window.dataLayer.push({

  event: ""gaEvent"",

  eventCategory: ""{eventCategory}"",

  eventAction: ""{eventAction}"",

  eventLabel: ""{eventLabel}"",

  eventValue: ""{eventValue}""

});

&amp;#x200B;

3) These events keys and values are surfaced through GTM from a dataLayer variable or JS variable 

&amp;#x200B;

4) These can then be used in tags and triggers 

&amp;#x200B;

Is this the way a conventional dataLayer works? So, are the steps above correct or am I missing anything? What i dont understand is, if i was to add scroll tracking based on the above configuration i'll need to add them as DLV then use it in my tags to create the scroll tracking?

r/analytics,"Background:

I have a BS in Statistics and I know how to use the common tools (Excel, SQL, Python, R, etc) but no working experience in Analytics. Since graduating college I was working in education (teaching math), with the idea of eventually transitioning into data analysis (and even more eventually, data science).

Current situation:

After sending out a lot of online applications, I finally got hired as an Analyst! I work at an ad agency and I started two weeks ago. The job is above the salary I was looking for, the benefits are great, and the work environment is great.

However, I’m not doing any data analysis.

Before I got hired, I could tell from the job description that the role wasn’t as analytical as some other roles I was looking at, as most of the description was devoted to managing projects. But another part of the description mentioned that I would be aggregating data and presenting reports, plus they said they would prefer Business/Math/Stats majors and proficiency in Excel. I still decided to apply, figuring it would be a good entry-level transition into Analytics, even if I was just using Excel.

During the interview they did the usual review of my prior experience. They specifically asked if I could create Excel macros and use VBA, and seemed excited that I had those skills.

On my first day, while going through orientation with IT, the IT guy mentioned that Analysts should download Python and SQL Server to their laptops. I was surprised, since thus far I expected I would be using Excel, but excited that I would be able to use more advanced tools on the job.

During training I learned the in-house and third-party tools the company uses for their workflow, but nothing to do with data analysis. I knew that project management was part of my job description, so I figured the analysis part of my training would come a bit later. After a week of training, I finally asked my supervisor when I would start doing data analysis, and he clarified that at that company they use the term Analyst for entry-level positions. For instance, if you were in the Planning department your roles would be Analyst, Planning; Supervisor, Planning; Director, Planning. An actual data analyst would be in the Analytics department (eg, Analyst, Analytics). It finally dawned on me that I had not been hired to do any data analysis.

I wasn’t the only one who was confused. I spoke to the other Analysts that were hired around the same time as me, and they were also wondering when they would be analyzing data.

I’m a bit disappointed, obviously. But I’m not in a position to quit this job, nor do I want to. I was financially unstable before, frequently dipping into my dwindling savings, and this new job has given me a lot of security.

Since I’m not planning to quit this job, what can I do to make the most it and gain experience for a future Data Analyst role? Luckily my current job isn’t completely divorced from data—in fact a large bulk of it has to do with data governance, so hopefully I can connect that to data analysis somehow. Also I may still be making reports, though in a very limited fashion. Plus I have the opportunity to gain a lot of valuable domain knowledge for the advertising industry.

What I’m doing right now:

-Using my free time at work and at home to develop my skills in SQL, Excel, etc.

-Attending local Data Science meetings to learn and meet people. Just recently I met someone who said he’d be happy to put in a good word for me at his job, so I’m holding onto that lead.

What I’m planning to do:

-Introduce myself to the Analytics team and ask about their work (I’m shy so this is surprisingly hard lol. Luckily they sit right behind me)

-Ask my boss if I can devote some of my free time at work to helping the Analytics team. I’m planning to wait until I’ve been here longer before making this possibly odd request.

I'm looking into graduate programs and before I make my decision, there's one thing I want to straighten out.

Hello!

I posted in r/SQL but did not receive many responses, so I wanted to see if y'all in this sub could help a fella out!

I currently work on a Data Warehousing team and have a significant understanding in joining data, subquerying, case statements, applying business logic, etc. I am more looking to get into the side of using these tables to do further analysis to impact business decision making / optimization. 

I would like to learn more about how to utilize SQL to do operational analysis (particularly focused on customer service and optimization - think a team trying to close customer tickets, etc.). I do not know much about using date functions, and trending data over time in SQL and am looking for a place to learn more about this. Particularly what I am looking for is to answer questions like ""What is our average rate of ticket closure compared to daily levels?"" ""Have we been able to become more effective on resolving tickets, and reduced the time it takes to close tickets over time?"" ""What's the average first touch point to a ticket?"" Etc.

I have taken a look at Datacamp's exploratory analysis online learning, which was helpful, but I would like to continue delve into this area to further firm out my understanding. Are there any places to learn how to better structure queries / use SQL to do this type of analysis that you've found successful? I would like to continue to practice and have limited access to this type of data to do so. Any ideas would be helpful! I.E. how to get access to this type of data to practice, online learning, books, etc.

Any type of SQL is fine. Also, if this is not the place to post this, then please let me know where else I should do so!

&lt;p&gt;And for UTM tags I now have an excel sheet, so I can look up different clients and keep using the same structure. This way I always know where to look in Google Analytics to find what I&amp;#39;m looking for :) and my data stays consistent.&lt;/p&gt;

I am in the process of configuring my new real estate sites GTM and confused on the optimal AW+GA conversion tracking configuration.

* I have Goals created in GA and linked my AW and GA accounts. Additionally, I also have the standard GA (All pageview trigger) tag applied to my GTM.

My question is since I have my GA and AW accounts linked, do I also need to set up the AW conversion tag?

r/analytics,"So I want to start off by saying I've been going through Google email, phone, and chat support for almost 2 months now.

ABC - Company my agency represents

CUNT - Their old IM agency

US - my agency

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Here's whats going on:

My agency manages client ABC. We handle their SEO, Internet Marketing, and Web Design. ABC used to use CUNT for their SEO and Marketing. CUNT was an awful agency and didn't show any progress or improvements, so they fired CUNT and hired us.

CUNT created an analytics account for ABC. ABC never had access to it as they delegated all work to CUNT. 

We took over ABC. I went to gain analytics access from CUNT, but he never responded to requests over the phone or email. On the phone, CUNT told me verbatim ""I have no access to that account anymore so I can't help you"". Ok, fine. So I contacted Google Support.

They had me prove authority to access the site. I did this by adding an analytics.txt to the domain as well as editing the Home page meta-description to show we have access to the back-end of the website as well.

I'm not quite sure what this process was for, since all Google had to do was send an email to CUNT asking CUNT to give US access to the account.

They did that and CUNT granted us access. However, CUNT only gave us read permissions. We need full ownership for obvious reasons. CUNT has absolutely nothing to do with ABC anymore. 

So I try to contact CUNT again and ask that he approves my management requests sent through email. He never approves these requests or responds to my separate emails. I go back and tell Google this, but all they will do is continue to send CUNT emails requesting ownership for US. This never works out because CUNT never approves the email.

So I get fed up and call CUNT today, and man was CUNT a cunt. He answers, I say ""Hello, this is John Doe with US, I had some questions about the analytics account for ABC if you had a minute or two?"".

CUNT says ""What do you want?""

I say ""Well we need ownership of ABC analytics so we can do with it what we need. You've giv----""

CUNT cut me off.

CUNT: ""I already worked with someone over there and got this taken care of.""

CUNT: ""Look, I am VERY BUSY. I don't have time for this.""

*Hangs up*

It's apparent that he has no interest in helping out and will never transfer the property to me. I've basically spammed him with management/ownership request emails at this point, and so had Google Support. I don't want to piss him off more though if he decides to delete ALL the data. 

I'm working on just downloading all the data separately and removing his tracking code and adding my own. This is my last resort though as we use tons of reporting softwares that require past analytics data.

I'm currently on hold with Google Support chat and have been for about 2 hours.

Does ANYBODY have any insights as to how I can get this fucking property? It's setting us back with ABC and I understand that CUNT is mad that his agency is so shit that they can't hold a simple client.

What can I do? Should I just download the data and start from scratch with a new account?

ABC even tried helping at one point by contacting CUNT, but that didn't work.

Thanks for reading and thanks for any info you can provide.",t2_d6wii,Can someone help me figure out a way to get ownership of an Account and Property? Long story inside...,,t3_fahni7,0.57,1,Question,1,1582861463.0,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;So I want to start off by saying I&amp;#39;ve been going through Google email, phone, and chat support for almost 2 months now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ABC - Company my agency represents&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CUNT - Their old IM agency&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;US - my agency&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s whats going on:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My agency manages client ABC. We handle their SEO, Internet Marketing, and Web Design. ABC used to use CUNT for their SEO and Marketing. CUNT was an awful agency and didn&amp;#39;t show any progress or improvements, so they fired CUNT and hired us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CUNT created an analytics account for ABC. ABC never had access to it as they delegated all work to CUNT. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We took over ABC. I went to gain analytics access from CUNT, but he never responded to requests over the phone or email. On the phone, CUNT told me verbatim &amp;quot;I have no access to that account anymore so I can&amp;#39;t help you&amp;quot;. Ok, fine. So I contacted Google Support.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They had me prove authority to access the site. I did this by adding an analytics.txt to the domain as well as editing the Home page meta-description to show we have access to the back-end of the website as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not quite sure what this process was for, since all Google had to do was send an email to CUNT asking CUNT to give US access to the account.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They did that and CUNT granted us access. However, CUNT only gave us read permissions. We need full ownership for obvious reasons. CUNT has absolutely nothing to do with ABC anymore. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I try to contact CUNT again and ask that he approves my management requests sent through email. He never approves these requests or responds to my separate emails. I go back and tell Google this, but all they will do is continue to send CUNT emails requesting ownership for US. This never works out because CUNT never approves the email.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I get fed up and call CUNT today, and man was CUNT a cunt. He answers, I say &amp;quot;Hello, this is John Doe with US, I had some questions about the analytics account for ABC if you had a minute or two?&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CUNT says &amp;quot;What do you want?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I say &amp;quot;Well we need ownership of ABC analytics so we can do with it what we need. You&amp;#39;ve giv----&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CUNT cut me off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CUNT: &amp;quot;I already worked with someone over there and got this taken care of.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Me: &amp;quot;Yes CUNT, that was me. Unfortunately we only got read access so we need ownershi---&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CUNT: &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;M VERY BUSY.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Me: &amp;quot;Understandable. I simply need you to approve this request. You still use the email &lt;a href=""mailto:cunt@CUNT.com""&gt;cunt@CUNT.com&lt;/a&gt;?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CUNT: &amp;quot;I haven&amp;#39;t gotten any emails. I&amp;#39;M VERY BUSY!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Me: &amp;quot;Again, I understand. I&amp;#39;m sending another request right now if you could quickly check it while I&amp;#39;m on the phone with you?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

r/analytics,"Hi Guys!

I recently had an interview for an internship for an analytics position. They asked me a couple questions but I couldn't answer this one

Here it is

We have something called an attractiveness quotient that goes from 0 to 1. 
Following are the factores affecting attractive quotient:-

1. Eye color - has 4 categories ( blue, brown, hazel, green)

2. Hair color - has 3 categories (blonde, black, brunette)

3. Weight 
4. Height 

Now the question was to find the correlation of all these variables to attractiveness quotient. He gave me a hint that the magnitude by which each of these variables affects the attractiveness quotient will be different obviously. And he said the answer is purely based on statistics and no machine learning or anything.

I only know Pearson's coefficient in correlation but I am very sure that won't help here :(

How do I solve this? Or even approach this problem? And how do I treat those different categories in the first 2 variables.

r/analytics,"  

hello,

I graduated with an accounting degree, was an accountant for 1 year and I am not a rly good accountant but after 1 year my boss suggested. me I apply to a new department that was forming up which is FP&amp;A (financial planning and analysis)

The reason he told me to apply was because I was good with power query, I knew how data flowed and was organized in the company and knew how to make relationship in power pivot and very basic DAX formula.

I need to mention all the data of the organisation are in a visual studio SSAS cube (same as power pivot but centralized when deployed)

Now my old boss was fire 2month after my promotion and he was the guy who built all the cube all table and linked and DAX and calculated column (pretty fucking advanced)

Now I've been 1year in the FP&amp;A position and I just got a bad review from my new boss (2/5). 2 main point of the review was, I was too much helping other department with the cube and wasn't focus enough on FP&amp;A, she told me some day I was 60% not at my desk because I was helping others. second point was that I sent some file without making enough validation before sending so there was some mistakes in it (as I said I am not the best accountant and honestly I do not have a lot of time to validate myself as I feel I am doing 4 jobs at the same time (FP&amp;A, Data modeler, IT Support, helping my old department in accounting as they are overwhelmed)

And it is true, but I am now the only person who has access and understand the cube in a 150ppl office. so yes, I often get calls from like the fiscality director saying he did a pivot table but numbers do not make sense, so I need to show up look at his slicers and realized he used the wrong measure or filter and help him out...Or I get a call from acocunting saying the new Accounting account she made in the accounting software doesn't show up in the pivot table and then I realized she didn't use an account from the master chart of account (my table in my model) so the account was showing in an empty row because it wasn't mapped, etc., etc., etc.

So at the end of the review we agreed I would let my senior (between me and my boss) know everytime I went to help an other department.

It has been a month since the review and I did let me senior know every single time I went to help, but everytime she told me it is fine to go after I tried to explained to her what the problem was or how critical it was. (So did I get a bad review for nothing? I do the exact samething as before the only difference is that I waste more time explaining it to my senior).

Anyway, I am writing this because I got a big demand from accounting this week so I told my senior it would take me 2-3days to implement, so she told my boss if it was okay, she said no you do not have time to waste 3 days on this, we are in year end and I need an analyst. So I had to see her because well this project is vital, accounting won't be able to be in compliance with the auditor without this project if it is not competed before FEB 27 (i did not told her that, because I thought she knew, but maybe she didn't, anyway) she agreed to let me work 2hours on the project but if it was more to just stop.

Of course it wasn't going to take 2 hours but I knew accounting needed it.... so what am I supposed to do? I told my senior this Friday before leaving that I would complete it during the weekend on my own time (like I have a choice...). and she replied if I would be able to show the DBA next week what I would have done, so I wouldn't have to deal with those thing in the future and be an analyst. I replied well it is not the DBA job to do the data modelisation (and I already spoke to the DBA prior to that and he agrees too, he is not an accountant and he doesn't know DAX, etc) and I saw on her face she just didn't understand and was a bit frustrated I wouldn't show the DBA (because for her it would solve the problem of me not having time to be an analyst)

I spoke to the IT director about that and he told me he wouldn't hire a full time Data scientist/Data modeler as we will probably change to an ERP software and it might replace the cube.

So now I am frustrated because I work and study BI and DAX and relationship model like crazy as I get stressed out something will crash anyday and I am the only one who understand what I do and how the data circulate in the organization. I just got told that everything I am studying might not exists in 2years anymore by the IT director. I got a bad review because I got too many responsibilities?!? I was also going to that interview expecting a stellar review and a big pay raise for all the stuff I do and the responsibilities I took... but I just think no one understands what I do....they just see me not performing as an analyst...and now I need to work pro bono during weekend to accomplish all my responsibilities without defying my boss max of 2 hours on this project...

I know I am a very bad communicator and I hate confrontation....I also just bought a house and I an now financially dependent on that job...I was kinda in shock during review so I just noded at everything when she was telling me why I got 2/5...maybe I should had try to confront my boss telling her it was a critical project and I needed to do it even if it was more than 2 hours.... but instead I just didn't confront her and I am doing it during my weekend...

anyway not sure what I expect from you guys.... but I do not thing it is sustainable to have that much anxiety about my future (ERP coming) and feeling guilty of helping other department when I know by boss doesn't like it... and feeling stress that the cube my old boss put in place, it is very advanced, and I am still pretty new to all this BI stuff, so I do not fully understands it either...I am also stress I might get fired by my boss since now I know she is unhappy with my performance...

anyway what would you guys do in my situation?

Ultimately I would love to keep studying BI and have a career in BI (as I really like this, a lot more than accounting/FP&amp;A) but I do not feel I know enough to switch job to a BI job.",t2_1itbsw4e,Career/Job Advice (from FP&amp;A to BI),,t3_f7sujk,0.67,1,,1,1582408754.0,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;hello,&lt;/p&gt;

r/datascience,"Hello all,

I am a Data Scientist at a Fortune 500 company, with a PhD in Electrical Engineering. For the last 5 years, I thought myself Python and Data Science and progressed a lot in that arena. I wanted some change after 5 years in the same company and wanted to explore options. Amazon AWS Pro Serve sounded interesting as you get to work with different companies. I did not want to work on a deep Machine Learning Problem on my cubicle (after corona, for now home desk :) ). I was excited about meeting new people and potentially solving data problems for different industries.

Am I making a right choice? Is Pro-serve considered to be same with, say ""Applied scientist"" role in AWS (asking in regards to: 1) career growth, 2) reputation and 3) financial) ? Is meeting new people and potentially gaining more exposure to different industries in Pro-serve a naive way of thinking? As we all know customer's behaviors can vary.

All in all I thought, exposing myself to different people and industries, in the future can help me even become an independent consultant, yes? Whereas If I am an applied scientist, I need to be deeply involved in ""creating the AWS tools from scratch"" vs using them in the AWS Pro-serve role.

If you have any experience with AWS Pro-serve data scientist roles, please chime in. Thanks in advance.

r/datascience,"Hi All, I have a background in Mechanical Engineering and would like to go back to school to learn data science after two years working in the manufacturing industry. I would like to stay within the traditional engineering realm (and not waste my experience in mechanical engineering) and apply data science tools to solve its problems. Hence I think an MS in Industrial &amp; Systems Engineering (MSISE) would be a good combination of the two. Another option would be an MS in Data Science (MSDS), though I know some of you have strong opinions about it. 

Although I am very interested in the courses offered in MSISE, I am also very intimidated by them as they are super math/theory heavy and academia-focused, compared to those offered in MSDS. I'm not sure how much of the MSISE courses would be directly applicable in the industry, but I also think I can learn most of the topics in MSDS online and would be paying for the network and credentials. Below are the courses I would be taking, both core and electives.

&amp;#x200B;

(left to right: prereqs to advanced courses)

**MSISE** 

|Intro to Optimization|Linear Optimization Models |Optimization: Fundamentals &amp; Applications ||
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Linear and Network Programming ||||
|Computer Programming II *(elective)*|Foundations of Computing I *(elective)*|Foundations of Computing II *(elective)*|Machine Learning *(elective)*|
|Continuous Time Linear Systems *(elective)*|Discrete Time Linear Systems *(elective)*|Random Signals for Communications and Signal Processing *(elective)*|Probability and Random Processes *(elective)*|
|Stochastic Processes in Engineering||||
|Healthcare Modeling *(elective)*||||
|Statistical Learning ||||
|Inferential Data Analysis for Engineers ||||

**MSDS**

|Data Visualization for Data Scientists |Data Management for Data Science |Software Design for Data Science |Scalable Data Systems and Algorithms |
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Human-Centered Data Science ||||
|Introduction to Statistics and Probability |Applied Statistics and Experimental Design |Statistical Machine Learning for Data Scientists ||
|Introduction to Microeconomics *(elective)*|Introduction To Information Systems *(elective)*|Business Data Analytics *(elective)*||
|Fundamentals of Managerial Accounting *(elective)*|Principles Of Operations Management *(elective)*|||
|Intro to Optimization *(elective)*||||
|Healthcare Modeling *(elective)*||||

&amp;#x200B;

Some other things to consider:

\- If I do decide to go the MSISE route, I will also be doing a thesis, which I already have a potential topic in mind with a professor to reach out to as it is within his field of expertise. 

\- Tuition would be waived if selected as a teaching or research assistant in MSISE.

&amp;#x200B;

So, which program would you recommend based on the value of the courses in the industry, and the potential return on investment (time/money/energy) of the degree?",t2_5inof,Dilemma: MS Industrial &amp; Systems Engineering or MS Data Science?,education,t3_hcye42,0.43,0,Education,0,1592732841.0,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi All, I have a background in Mechanical Engineering and would like to go back to school to learn data science after two years working in the manufacturing industry. I would like to stay within the traditional engineering realm (and not waste my experience in mechanical engineering) and apply data science tools to solve its problems. Hence I think an MS in Industrial &amp;amp; Systems Engineering (MSISE) would be a good combination of the two. Another option would be an MS in Data Science (MSDS), though I know some of you have strong opinions about it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although I am very interested in the courses offered in MSISE, I am also very intimidated by them as they are super math/theory heavy and academia-focused, compared to those offered in MSDS. I&amp;#39;m not sure how much of the MSISE courses would be directly applicable in the industry, but I also think I can learn most of the topics in MSDS online and would be paying for the network and credentials. Below are the courses I would be taking, both core and electives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(left to right: prereqs to advanced courses)&lt;/p&gt;

r/datascience,"Hey everyone,

I work as a DS for a fortune 100 company. It’s my first data science role and I’ve been here a little short of a year. We have no way of implementing models and I’ve built a few production worthy scoring engines. The company is trying to get up to speed with analytics and data science but is still behind in the curve in terms of technology and utilizing data and their data scientists.

This leads to my question. Is anyone else in a role where you are “looking for drivers” or “key factors” regularly. It seems as though this is a huge majority of the work and all people care about. “Looking for segments” or “tell stories”. It seems extremely trivial and the amount of work reducing extremely wide datasets to a selection of variables that can tell a story is a relatively big task. They’re so open ended and can tend to be misleading. This feels like more of a business analytics role (even though so many titles seem arbitrary). They’re looking to have a production ready environment by the end of this year but it seems that actually having the business utilize scoring engines is unlikely. 

Doing these segmentations or “drivers” of events is what stakeholders care about. Is this very common in data science? Am I looking at this position wrong?

&lt;p&gt;I work as a DS for a fortune 100 company. It’s my first data science role and I’ve been here a little short of a year. We have no way of implementing models and I’ve built a few production worthy scoring engines. The company is trying to get up to speed with analytics and data science but is still behind in the curve in terms of technology and utilizing data and their data scientists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This leads to my question. Is anyone else in a role where you are “looking for drivers” or “key factors” regularly. It seems as though this is a huge majority of the work and all people care about. “Looking for segments” or “tell stories”. It seems extremely trivial and the amount of work reducing extremely wide datasets to a selection of variables that can tell a story is a relatively big task. They’re so open ended and can tend to be misleading. This feels like more of a business analytics role (even though so many titles seem arbitrary). They’re looking to have a production ready environment by the end of this year but it seems that actually having the business utilize scoring engines is unlikely. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Doing these segmentations or “drivers” of events is what stakeholders care about. Is this very common in data science? Am I looking at this position wrong?&lt;/p&gt;

r/datascience,"Hey everyone.

I'm about to graduate and get my masters degree next week and I have a tough decision to make. I've been working full time job for the last year in one of the biggest IT consulting companies out there as a big data intern, however my academic background is also more about analytics and statistics (i'm graduating in ""Computer Science and Econometrics"").

My main repsopnsibilites in current position are: building a star schema data warehouse (using SQL and Spark), bugfixes in existing tables, adding new source tables etc. I have never done any Kafka related stuff nor some extreamly-advanced pipelines using Spark Streaming or other tools. Most of them were quite complicated SQL queries (with over 1k lines of code). Within next 3 months the client I'm working for is going to be migrating from Hive to Snowflake and Wherscape, do you think knowing those would be benefitial to add to my resume? I would also learn some Amazon Athena and S3.

In my free time I often do kaagle competitions (just to test my skills and have some portfolio projects), prepare some ML models, try to do some predictive analysis. I really dont want to let those skills ""fade"" and develop in analytics as well.

All the technologies/languages I have worked with are: SQL, Python (more analytical python, so libraries like: numpy, seaborn, scikit-learn, pandas etc.), R (although I hate it), Scala (basic scala to understand Spark better), Spark (also pySpark), Hive (Hive-QL), Apache Ariflow (althow I know how to trigger a job and read logs, not really how to write complicated scheduling scripts), Jenkins, Git, Jira.

Now, I really have a tough decision to make. Should I stay in my current job as data engineer (with promotion to regular engineer, not an intern anymore) or look into more data science field. What do you guys think would be more lucrative within the next 5-10 years? Is there any way I could lets say, within a year or two, easily change fields from data engineering to data science? I guess I would be pretty good at data preparation and cleaning in that time. Is knowlege of those technologies mentioned above superficial in case I wanted to change? Should I learn anything specific? Also, if I decide to stay in the current position, I can take certification exams in SQL and Spark. Would it be benefitial in data science?

I do a lot of data engineering in oracle, creating repositories for internal apps and to serve to other enterprise apps outside of my department.  And lots of analysis via PLSQL queries against our database that runs our business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have practically no experience in Machine Learning or Neural Networks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most folks are classified as business analysts here.  Which is a range of people who use the gui of our business system and configure it via gui prompts, to devOps and our front and back end developers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I tapped out of the front end game as data was my thing.  (Im way above average with my SQL and subject matter expertise of Oracle systems) And over the last year have really been learning R and Shiny apps to where we have a lot of real time dashboards and metrics to view (some on always on wall displays).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you think I can sell the &amp;#39;Data Scientist&amp;#39; role to help reclassify myself here?   I.E.  Can I refer to myself in practice as a data scientist without have Deep learning/machine learning/neural network skills in my toolbox?&lt;/p&gt;

I have a database of \~20 variables that are collected continuously over time. This database is essentially measuring the conditions of the interplanetary magnetic field (too complex to model) which drives numerous phenomena that occur in the Earth's atmosphere, etc. These phenomena are of interest to researchers but only occur ever so often. To find these, you have to manually search years and years of data, something that is simply not too practical.

I want to develop some sort of method to take a number of instances of a phenomenon and search the continuous database for more instances. I think that this needs to be split into two tasks.

1. Discover common patterns (dips, spikes, sign changes, or even more complex ""shapes"") between the inputted instances. It will also have to discern the variables of interest because not all in the database will drive a single phenomenon. Moreover, if the program can then output these relationships (such as variables appear to drive the phenomenon) this will be of interest to users.
2. Use these relationships to search the continuous stream for more instances.

Like I mentioned, I am not very experienced in data science.

**THE PROBLEM**

I have a sample product that is comprised of let's say 3 ingredients, each with concentrations listed in ranges of the total product composition:

|Ingredient|min concentration (%)|max concentration (%)|
|:-|:-|:-|
|x|25|50|

If x = 50% y = 25% and z = 25%, then the product has a toxicity score of say 100.

But if x = 25%, y = 50% and z = 25%, then the product has a toxicity score of perhaps 75.

This is a real world problem (ingredients are often listed in ranges), so I guess I can assume normality of the distribution of each ingredient range (or uniformity?).

r/datascience,"These past weeks I've been working on an ML web app as a side project. Being a Data Scientist, I decided to take on this project for two reasons. First, it would make for a good learning experience for the things I'm not very comfortable with like Design/Front-end and Deployment tasks. Second, as I found most of the materials lacking, I thought I could gather some useful information to write a blog post about it.

I made a web app that tracks the sentiment on twitter towards the leaders of the top political parties in Spain. It works —more or less— in real-time. The site is live here: [https://polituits.com/](https://polituits.com/)

Some things went well, others that I could have done better, and others that at this point I'm not sure haha (e.g., How much traffic would it handle?). I thought I could share those things before getting to work on the blog post.

I'll start with the **things that made my life easier:**

1. [End-to-end Machine Learning App](https://www.ahmedbesbes.com/case-studies/end-to-end-ml-app). This is a great resource. It goes through the full process of building a Machine Learning application in a realistic setting. Most of the materials you'll find out there will skip deployment or work with simple data sets. This one goes from scraping to deploying in AWS. A few days ago, I also read [this one](http://veekaybee.github.io/2020/06/09/ml-in-prod/), which I also recommend.
2. [Dash](https://plotly.com/dash/). I compared Streamlit and Dash and went with the latter for better documentation and a more significant community. The deployment part was especially painful, so proper documentation was critical to get the job done.
3. [HugginFace's Transformers](https://huggingface.co/). If you are working with NLP tasks in languages other than English, check HuggingFace's repository of community models. Furthermore, it is relatively easy to integrate into an inference service built with Pytorch/Flask.
4. [Abhishek Thakur's tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBPRJjIWfyNG4X-CRbnv78A) and [Kaggle Notebooks](https://www.kaggle.com/abhishek/notebooks) for fine-tuning BERT. Fantastic resources that saved me a lot of time. Especially when using those ideas with a pre-trained BERT in Spanish from HuggingFace's transformers.
5. More generally, I benefited from keeping the toolset simple. I used PowerPoint when I started designing the app (see the initial design [here](https://twitter.com/_dylancastillo/status/1272238506916675591)), SQLite as a database, and Python/Dash (instead of JavaScript).

Now, the **things that I wish I had done differently:**

1. Contain the scope. I started with a straightforward idea and then started adding stuff that just made my life harder. Most of the time, I think it was because I felt the app was not ""complex"" enough for publishing it.
2. Deployment. Ha! The only good thing about it's that it ""works"". Right now, it is a painfully manual process. I should have gotten to a better deployment process from the beginning. By the time I started deploying, it felt like too much work.
3. Sacrificed code quality. I wanted to ship this quickly. So the code is not DRY. It's more like CRY yourself to sleep. Refactoring is among my top priorities now.
4. Model. It's not great right now. It only gets the job done. I did not dedicate that much time to labeling data for fine-tuning the model. This is also a priority for me right now.

Finally, there are many things for which I don't know if I was following the ""best practices."" In particular, setting up NGINX and Gunicorn felt a bit *hacky*. Sooner or later, I guess I'll find out.

r/datascience,"Hi everyone,

Thought I'd share some advice that has helped me so far in my Data Science career. It has to do with recording your wins at work - hope you like it!

\-----

The human brain is terrible at remembering information.

When we try to use the past to predict the future, we end up using *our memory* of the past. And our memory is extremely flawed, subject to whims and emotions.

One of the biggest consequences of this is at work.

You clock in 9-5 for days on days and then when you look back at what you did a year ago, you think “Where did all that time go?”

Even worse, if YOU can’t remember what the hell you did, how will your boss?

In an ideal world: you do a great job, your company rewards you. They’ll notice all the hard work you’re putting in. All the beautiful lines of code you’ve written.

But we don’t live in an ideal world. And the costliest mistake you can make in your career is not being proactive about recording your achievements and your little wins.

**Enter The Brag Document**

I first read about a Brag Document on [Julia Evan’s blog](https://jvns.ca/blog/brag-documents/#template).

By recording your small wins and accomplishments on a weekly basis, you accumulate concrete evidence of what you’ve achieved.

And these “wins” don’t need to be Olympic Gold Medals.

Did you help a coworker understand how to use an API? Jot it down.

Did you anticipate a nasty bug and proactively reach out about it? It goes on there.

Did you help mentor a junior employee? That’s definitely part of it.

Over time, I promise you, your brag document will do wonders for your career.

Sure - negotiating a raise or getting a promotion will become easier. In fact, come performance review time, even your boss will thank you for it. Those things are hard to write from pure memory. More on this a bit later.

But the biggest benefit of a brag document lies in identifying *what you enjoy doing*.

Your wins are likely a representation of tasks you enjoyed. And you should be very proactive about focusing on those tasks going forward.

Use your Brag Document to ruthlessly identify the tasks you want to spend more time on, as well as the tasks you don’t want to do anymore.

**The Pareto Principle**

The Pareto Principle states that 80% of the effects come from 20% of the causes.

At work, 80% of what you can feel proud about will stem from 20% of what you do. You can think of your Brag Document as representing that 20%.

Use this 20% to ask yourself questions like:

* Is there a common theme amongst this work?
* Are there topics here that I thought I didn’t actually like but turns out I do?
* How much of this work involves collaboration with other departments / teams?
* How can I do more of this work?

**Frequency**

Update your brag document on a weekly basis. You can set it as a recurring event on your calendar.

The biggest benefit of this is that it forces you to scrutinize your output on a regular basis and allows you to be proactive about focusing on the work you want to do.

Let’s say that after a few weeks of work, you genuinely have nothing to put on your brag document.

There’s a chance you had a bit of a slow period at work, but maybe you’re just stuck somewhere you don’t want to be?

**Collaborate**

Talk about your brag document with co-workers. Ask them what you think you should put on yours.

You’ll often find that they’re able to mention things you completely forgot or didn’t even seem to think about.

Remember - just because something seems easy *to you* doesn’t mean it’s easy in general. 5 minutes of work may have taken you 10 years to learn.

You should also encourage your team to keep their own brag documents. Help each other be accountable and celebrate each other’s wins. This builds a strong team culture.

**Your Manager**

You should try to share your brag document with your manager once a quarter.

It might seem **weird** or **unnatural** \- you’re basically dumping all your achievements into their lap. But this actually really makes their life easier.

If your manager ever needs to vouch for you internally, then boom - they have direct evidence they can use. If your manager needs to reshuffle workload, then they know what you’re good at and what you can improve on.

Even better, you and your manager should go through your brag document together.

Tell them what you want to do more of. Tell them what you wish was on there more.

You’ll both be able to identify areas in which you’re doing a great job and also areas in which your manager perhaps wants you to focus on more.

Another aspect that’s helpful here is with goal setting - your manager and you likely work together anyway to determine quarterly goals.

You should use your brag document to help you identify what type of goals you need to be hitting. Very often, we will achieve goals and then think “Wait..what was the point again?”

By using your brag document to set goals, you’ll be much more likely to be working towards something that you find rewarding.

**Ending thoughts**

Once you start getting in the habit of using a brag document, operating without one will feel like doing your work in the dark.

Over time, you’ll develop a much clearer picture of the type of work that you want to focus on for your career.

r/datascience,"I'm working for an R&amp;D tech company, and my team is developing a niche NLP product. I have developed a serious interest in NLP, but I secretly wish I could use NLP for my personal projects (of which I have plenty of ideas), rather than my job.

- Having to read so many badly-written papers and repos. Furthermore, I find the leaderboard chasing and the Frankenstein deep learning models quite off-putting (do we really need transformer + CNN + multi-task learning + multi-lingual model + dual-encoder evaluated on 10 different datasets without any deeper analysis within a single paper?).
- Many of the deep learning models might work well in some leaderboard, but incorporating them to our data is rife with logistical and performance issues. Worse is that most of them are just black-box models with little means to debug if they return a wrong result.

Fortunately, I am at a company with many data scientists on other teams, so the isolation is not 100%.

I’ve already had helpful conversations where these data scientists \[outside my team\] share answers to questions like “what does your role look like”, “what’s something you knew when you first started” and other such broad topics.

Would really love to give some students the opportunity at an internship/results boost, but also don’t want to set them up for a terrible experience.&lt;/p&gt;

r/datascience,"Hello my fellow data science professionals, I hope you all are keeping safe and doing well.

So a bit of background to the question, one of my close friend runs a business which operates in the event &amp; entertainment industry.
He is a vendor that provides a niche service for large format events &amp; activations. let's call this service A for the sake of this post.

Service A requires a lot of equipment and people who are skilled in operating that equipment. He has his own large inventory of equipment but once in a while, he gets an event with a large scope, wherein to be able to provide that service, he has to purchase more inventory, which might be used immediately or can remain with him for a long time.
He has employees hired to manage and deliver the service, but again if the scope of an event is large, he hires freelance manpower to execute and provide the said service.  

As a nature of the industry itself, everything is need-based. the way it usually works is:
A client (can be corporate or a wealthy private client) sends out a brief of what he/they intend to celebrate or organize an event -&gt; This brief usually goes out to few event management companies -&gt; these companies propose a plan/theme/budget -&gt; client approves it/negotiates on a budget -&gt; event happens.

Now, the event management companies can approach my friend for service A, either during the proposal phase or after the proposal is approved in which case they have already factored in a service A in their proposal and budgeted a certain amount for it.
Each approach by the event company is considered as an incoming inquiry for hiring his services.

My friend approached me if I can help him out in some way using data science. I have been thinking about but cannot figure out a an idea to model for. Whatever I do I want to ensure that it helps his bottom line. As you can imagine, the current pandemic has destroyed the industry and his business altogether, and since he has some time, he asked me for my help in gathering some insights which will enable him to tweak his processes for the future.

I thought of modeling for his handling of inquiries, wherein I can glean some insight into the probability of an inquiry turning into a business which helps him focus his resources on something which has more probability of generating revenue, but again he and his business are blind to what is going on at the event manager side, he only sees what comes to him and he keeps track of it.

There are other aspects of his business where I believe something can be done, for example, Inventory management &amp; analysis, optimizing operational manpower (he uses inhouse and freelance manpower for his business), but these do not directly help in bottom line, they will help indirectly in a long term and I'm not discounting it, it's just not a priority for him.

So basically what I'm asking is, has anyone modeled for a business that is inherently unpredictable like stock markets and what would you even start looking at which will translate into the bottom line for the company.

r/datascience,"I am working on a pet project, where I am trying to find scope of improvement in services of a telecom company and also the customer care interactions.

Customers can use any channel to change their plan - web, app, call care support, chat with an agent, visit store etc. I am looking for a way to measure pain in their journey while changing plans - how much time did it take to browse plans and make a choice, was the app experience so bad that the customer had to call care center, were there any wrong expectations set or miscommunication that made the customer call back care after the change (issues with billing, device etc)

One way I thought made sense would be to use CSAT score, find correlation with features like time spent, number of calls or visits, number of times channels was switched, and try to come up with a way to quantify the pain experienced in each step.

Customers can use any channel to change their plan - web, app, call care support, chat with an agent, visit store etc. I am looking for a way to measure pain in their journey while changing plans - how much time did it take to browse plans and make a choice, was the app experience so bad that the customer had to call care center, were there any wrong expectations set or miscommunication that made the customer call back care after the change (issues with billing, device etc)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One way I thought made sense would be to use CSAT score, find correlation with features like time spent, number of calls or visits, number of times channels was switched, and try to come up with a way to quantify the pain experienced in each step. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me know your thoughts on this, does the above approach makes sense? Is there a better way to do this?&lt;/p&gt;

r/datascience,"Hello everyone,

I've seen variations of the question ""What is the future of data science?"" asked before, but I think mine is unique enough that it would make for a good discussion in its own post. It's based on a 2020 RStudio Conference presentation mentioned in some other posts, called ""[Value in Data Science Beyond Models in Production](https://rstudio.com/resources/rstudioconf-2020/value-in-data-science-beyond-models-in-production/)"".

In the presentation, the speaker makes the case for why Data Scientists should focus their efforts on providing value through things ***other than*** deploying machine learning to production. As an aside, I think the definition of ""Data Scientist"" he is using is more of a Decision Scientist. The gist of his message is:

* Machine Learning Engineers are likely going to take the ML work that Data Scientists currently do, and will create off-the-shelf ML tools (e.g. AutoML), hence decreasing the need for Data Scientists to do ML.
* Data Engineers are already better than Data Scientists at cleaning data, building pipelines, and warehousing, and so this part of the data science process will be owned by Data Engineers.
* What work does that leave for Data Scientists? What the speaker describes sounds like the work of a Product Analyst:
   * Business Intelligence-type work (metric design, measurement, goal-setting, creating self-service data tools)
   * A small amount of ad-hoc ML modeling
   * Inform business strategy / product design based on data analysis
   * Experimentation
   * The human side of data work - ethics and communication

'tis the time. Show me your DS Stack! Our field is going through rapid transitions, many of these focused on operationalization (yes it is a word). In a sense, how do we jump from the '*guy in the basement who comes up with cool models*' to '*well oiled machinery that spits out and maintains awesome models*'. 

Let's standardise the responses somewhat, then I'll collect the responses as much as I can at the end of this main post. 

I'd like people to simply list the technology they use at their firm. Some of us may use experiment tracking, others do not. Some may require high-frequent updates, others do not, and so forth.

Please add a link to the technology you refer to :-)

**Tech. challenges I've yet to find a solution for:**

* How to best manage models that read/write from DBs best way possible?
* Efficient ways to automatically run tests on X independent separate ML models
* Best way to store and access (large) flat files

**Curious to try or work with**

* Kubeflow
* MLflow
* GCP vs AWS vs Azure vs Bluemix - Pros/Cons?

**Best advice**

* If you don't have one already - Design a standardised best practices handbook for your team. You should have a template for a DL project, as well as smaller ML projects. The template should be designed in a way that allows for easy reproducibility and productisation (See previous post I've written [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/gw8z13/do_you_code_in_object_oriented_way_in_python_when/fsu2p8p?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x))

r/datascience,"Hi,

I'm considering using airflow for my ML pipeline on AWS, and I have some questions about basic setup (perhaps noobish). 

I would prefer a serverless setup, but that seems out of the question in the cloud, since you have to host an airflow server?

The airflow server seems like a bit of an overkill, and I'm unsure how to control costs, scaling, python environments and memory/cpu/gpu requirements to each pipeline step?

Alternatively I thought about using it as 'command station', where the ML pipeline just delegates pipeline tasks to fargate and lambda functions - this seems nice, because I can get all the flexibility that I want using those other services, while keeping the server small.  


The reason I want to use airflow is of course because it seems awesome, and I would like to have that overview over the pipes etc. I could just setup a bunch of lambdas/containers, but I would never know if anything had failed.

r/datascience,"Hello!

I'm a junior data scientist, been working in the field for about a year after getting a professional master in this topic.

I work for a small startup, which means that I have no mentor and I have to figure out shit on my own, as well as deal with everything that is data related (not just data science, but also engineering, ETL and what not).

It's fun and challenging, but also at times very frustrating, because I have this constant feeling of *never knowing enough,* and given the complexity and depth of this field, and the pace at which it develops, it is really overwhelming.

Also, coming from a business / economics background, my math and stats skills are not exactly razor sharp.  
I compensate by being a massive nerd, so I learn stuff quickly, but that's about it.

r/datascience,"Some background: I have 6 years of DS experience, 2 masters degrees, and spent a few years as a data analyst as well. Laid off from a smaller company in the midwest due to COVID-19 cutbacks.

&amp;#x200B;

1. **""Data scientist"" is turning into a blanket term. So is ""data analyst"".** So many of the jobs I've looked at truly want a data engineer/DBA but ask for a data scientist. Or want a data scientist but ask for an entry level data analyst. Expand your search terms, but read the job description to figure out what the company really wants. This changes every time I'm on the job market even in my short tenure as a data scientist. When did ""Machine Learning Engineer"" become so big??
2. **On that note: ""Senior"" vs ""Lead"" vs ""Entry Level""**...the difference to me is huge, but most companies seem to be pretty flexible with what they're posting. Some entry level jobs have been open to changing to senior level, some lead/manager level would be fine with senior. If you like a job but are weary about the experience required, just ask the hiring manager/recruiter that posted it.
3. **Every company has a different way of testing your knowledge.** So far I've taken a data science timed assessment (no outside resources), completed a take-home assessment (48 hours and a dataset), and presented a past project for 30 minutes, all for different companies. Be prepared for just about anything, but use how they test you as a clue into their culture. For me, I love the take-home tests and presentations because they give me a chance to show what I know without as much of the pressure.
4. **Companies are starting to open back up.** Many job postings were taken down from March-May, but as of today the number of openings is expanding rapidly. Region may be a big factor. The companies I have interviewed with have stuck to either all virtual, or majority virtual with one in-person interview with masks and social distancing.

I need some collective knowledge on collaborative data science. Mainly what I am looking for is to get a better overview over my teams experiments / training of models.  


Our current state:  
We are currently training NN for Computer Vision using jupyter notebooks, csv files for labels and operation systems directories to store the images. People execute their notebooks and they sometimes get errors because someone else is currently training on that gpu (of which we have 2).

  
So what am I looking for?  
1. A data store for our datasets with some kind of data lineage. (Can be solved by postgres or what ever. Fair enough.)  
2. Provisioning of some kind of execution queue so that people can queue up their notebooks and have the results 24h later.  
3. A multi tenant experiment store (like model db, ml flow -- but I would like it to have support for multiple users).  
4. The possibility to review and comment on experiments so that we can assist and teach each other. Similar to how gitlab handles pull / merge requests.  
5. OpenSource.  
6. Optional: self-hostable for free.   


Multi Tenancy is a must for me. We need open discussions on approaches to Data Science / ML Problems. So is open source -- mainly for the same reason.

r/datascience,"Hi folks! I am currently working as a Software Engineer in a Reporting/Analysis team using SAP BO and SQL.

I have taken a bunch of MOOC courses and had worked on common UCI datasets. I have recently started with Kaggle as well (trying the basic one's right now). I know I have to improve a lot, but this question keeps on pondering me, as the interviewer was okay with me working with iris dataset as I am fresher with less than 1 year of full-time experience. He just wanted to know my answer to the above question. I tried thinking and giving a generalized answer but he wasn't impressed and asked how did you solve iris problem.

I keep seeing threads on this forum about how disappointed so many people are with their data science jobs.

&amp;#x200B;

I think expectations need to be managed, in any line of work:

1. **Seniority / juniority**:  When you start as a medical doctor, you won't start by diagnosing Dr. House-like rare, life-threatening conditions straight away. If you join a law firm, you won't start by passionately and single-handedly defending your clients in court like in a John Grisham book. If you join Goldman Sachs as a graduate, you won't start by managing multi-billion trades and investments straight away. **Any job has a certain amount of grunt work, which is greater at the very beginning of your career**. The world is full of bright kids disappointed with their first jobs, wondering: ""did I really study 3/4/5 years to change the colours of a PowerPoint slide?"".
2. **Importance within the organisation**: this varies wildly from place to place but, generally, regardless of the guff HR says, in many organisations there is a clear difference in the food chain between the functions which are seen as generating revenues and those which are seen as support functions. In many places, the sales team (or equivalent) brings home the money, and everyone else is seen as a support function. You don't need to argue with me that this is shortsighted: you need to understand that this attitude is common, need to do your homework on what the culture is like before joining a company, and make your decisions accordingly.
3. **(related to #2): what is the background of the senior people?** If you are a data scientist in a company where most senior executives have some kind of technical background, you are more likely to be appreciated than in a company where the senior guys (it's almost always guys...) are all salespeople who go into sensory shutdown the moment you mention anything more complicated than the times tables.
4. **what are the real needs of the business?** Even in the most enlightened organisation, with the most technical sensible competent open-minded etc etc executives, **there will be more need for boring work than for exciting, cutting-edge work**. For every person that must do proper R&amp;D and brand-new, cutting edge models processes technologies etc, there will need to be many more people that must manage and maintain the existing processes and models, which is important even if less interesting",t2_3gsivx5o,"So many people disappointed with their jobs.

So we’re looking to cluster our social demographic data. I’m pretty new to clustering validation and when to say, “this is good enough.” 

We have no pre labeled data to test our clusters,  only silhouette scores of ~ 0.65

At what point do I stop optimizing clustering problems, or is it subjective?

We aim to label the data into 5~6 clusters (domain knowledge from my boss suggests in theory there should be 5~6 categories. Will discuss with him more), 

We wish to use the data to synthesize new data. I’m not too sure how we will achieve this, maybe a variational Autoencoder, or we simply find the closest centroid for data of our choice and sample from the centroid (this is the added restriction that our data is distributed in different ways as we are working with real estate data)

&lt;p&gt;total number of assets --&amp;gt; total
maximum allocation(in weights) --&amp;gt; max = .15
minimum allocation (in weights) -&amp;gt; min = 1/total/2
My goal is that the algortihm gives the first asset the maximum --&amp;gt; P(1|max),
The y value should be expotentially decreasing but should not be lower than min.
And the sum of weights should be close as possible to 1.
How can I accomplish that ?
--&amp;gt; I looked into scipy curve fitting, but I do not know how to apply it&lt;/p&gt;

r/datascience,"Hey guys -

Had the opportunity to interview a Data Scientist at Uber on their Shared Rides Team. Thought I'd share some of it here, in case you find it helpful :)

**What do you do &amp; where do you work?**

My name is Divyansh Agarwal and I am a data scientist at Uber in San Francisco. I’m working on  the Shared Rides business, and work on building products that grow the business. Some of my work also involves optimizing the efficiency of Uber’s ride sharing marketplace by improving graph optimization algorithms for rider-driver matching, and evaluating their performance via experimentation and simulations.

**When did you first become interested in Data Science?**

So, I had an interest in machine learning and predictive analytics before going into university. I wrote about it in my college essays as well.

But I was also interested in software engineering and fields like security. What really made me truly interested in data science was taking [Data 8](http://data8.org/) at UC Berkeley. I really liked the fact that you could use statistics to extract insights from data and provide value - and although I had always been aware of this, I only realized then how powerful statistics could be and how computing facilitates all of this.

After that, I started doing a bunch of projects, some internships, and got involved in research.

**When applying for jobs, was it hard to choose between going for a software engineering role as opposed to a data science role?**

Not really - I was always set on data science once I got into it. I used software engineering more as a backup, because given my CS background it would have been easy to get a software job if I just prepped hard for their interviews.

It’s actually harder to get a data science job out of undergrad. This is because there’s a general bias towards people with graduate degrees and people with a lot of experience. So you need to have either of both - either you need to have a lot of work experience, or you need to have a PHD.

So that’s why I built experience through doing projects, research, internships, etc.

For Data Science, there’s no real standardized process when it comes to interviewing - it varies a lot from company to company (this is in contrast to software engineering where using websites like LeetCode can get you ready for almost all jobs).

So I had to spend a lot of time prepping for each specific company I interviewed with - at every stage of the process - and this ended up taking a lot of time.

**When applying to Uber, did you have projects in mind you wanted to work on? How much did you know about the company?**

After my sophomore year of college, I was invited for this intern open house at Uber. That’s when I met some of the team across rides, security, and eats. I spoke to this guy on the marketplace team and another guy on the maps team, I was really interested in those teams.

What’s really cool about the marketplace team specifically is that it’s at the intersection of computer science, economics, optimization, statistics, and there’s a lot of hard &amp; interesting problems that can be solved from an algorithmic perspective.

So after this event I attended, I knew that I wanted to be on the marketplace team at Uber. So during my senior year recruiting, I reached out to someone on the marketplace team, and they were interested in me, so that’s how I started interviewing at Uber.

**What is your team responsible for and why is this work critical to Uber’s business?**

I’m on the Shared Rides team (which is a part of Marketplace Dynamics). The core of building new shared rides products and features come from [matching improvements](https://marketplace.uber.com/matching) or UI and experience improvements. So either tweaking these algorithms, designing &amp; analyzing experiments, understanding how users are responding to new product features - these are all very important and central to Uber’s business.

What are some challenges (both technical and non-technical) your team faces?

The biggest challenge for our team (and I think this is true for any consumer internet product) is building something that people actually like that meets your business objectives. Because everytime you change something with the product, one metric might become worse and the other might become better.

It’s also really hard to figure out what users really want and what they really like. This involves a lot of UX research, as well as experimentation. This stuff is really challenging. Here’s another example:

So, there’s an optimization &amp; efficiency side of Shared Rides - there’s always a tension between the two. If I make something more optimal, it might hurt the experience. If I make the experience better, we have to give some leeway on the optimization side of things. So that’s this underlying technical tension that’s always there.

On the product side, as I had already mentioned, it just comes down to building something users really want. So we have designers and UX researchers who are embedded within shared rides, as well as marketing folks, and I have to work cross functionally with these guys to problem solve on a daily basis.

**You interned at Quora before Uber - can you tell me differences between both companies and how that affected your work?**

So Quora was a very small company - there were only 230 people or so when I was working there (two years ago). There were fewer layers of management, it was easier to know people across the company - for example I even got the chance to speak with the CEO on a couple of occasions. There was also less bureaucracy I guess.

At Uber, since it’s a bigger company, sometimes if you want to build something you might need to get buy-in from another team, there’s more bureaucracy, there’s more layers between you and executive management.

Like at Quora, I knew the Head of Data Science very well, but at Uber I can’t imagine doing that currently (given I’ve just begun my career).

At a bigger company like Uber though, you’re working on projects that have bigger scope, bigger impact on the world, and you work with a lot more people. I’m also more specialized within my role here at Uber - at Quora I could have had more flexibility in terms of what I wanted to work on. At Uber, I’m on a very specific team, in a very specific role, working on a very specific part of the product. This has significant advantages: We’re working on specialized problems that are really challenging, and I’m surrounded by people who have been thinking deeply about these problems for a while are are super passionate about these problems. There’s some incredible learning to be had there.

Finally, in a smaller company it’s also a lot easier to hang out with your teammates - Quora for instance had organized clubs (poker, badminton etc) across the board that made it really easy to meet people in different teams. At Uber, that’s much harder to do, but you meet an equivalent amount of people within your own team, since teams are much larger at Uber.

**What advice would you give to someone looking to become a Data Scientist (either a career changer or a college student)?**

Data science roles are defined very differently based on the team, company, size, role you’re working on. For instance, even Uber Data Science can vary greatly across teams - for example, I work on the Shared Rides / Matching team, which is mostly Operations Research, which is a field about optimization. And I didn’t even study Operations Research in college. The important thing to understand is that different teams have different scopes. For instance, the pricing team does a lot of machine learning. Some other teams are trying to understand user experience. So having a strong base is really important, because at companies like Uber, there’s many directions you could go in.

In the Data Science industry overall, there’s broadly three tracks:

1. Algorithms (building models, doing ML)
2. Inference (understanding causality)
3. Analytics (building dashboards, writing SQL, reporting metrics, analyzing simple A/Bs)

Most of the Data Science jobs involve Analytics or Inference.

At Quora, they were mostly on the inference side of things. They were trying to understand product opportunities, trends in user behavior, and see if new product features were impactful.

On Uber, on my team at least, I’m more focused on building algorithms.

So in terms of advice: you need to focus on what you’re actually interested in (within the domains listed above). Of course, there’s going to be work that’s a mix of both, but knowing which topics interest you will help you map out and identify which companies you want to work for.

Everything is going to be very team and company specific, so don’t look at titles, but actually look at what the role is, talk to people on the team, and do your research.

Stats theory is also important, but on the job you’re not really going to be actively using theory too much. What really matters is understanding and gaining intuition. For example, I didn’t study a lot of Operations Research in college, but I took a bunch of Machine Learning and Algorithms classes in college which helped me build intuition for how Operations Research works, since the field is about optimization - which is what Machine Learning and Algorithms are about.

The purpose of theory is to build intuition and understand things.

r/datascience,"Dear data-scientists,

**How do you guys prevent non-technical errors and bugs ?**

&amp;#x200B;

I work as a data-scientist in a junior position. My typical workflow consist of the following steps :

 1) the client gives us a problem 

2) think about proper methodology 

3) gather the data necessary to solve the problem 

4) apply some statistical procedures to solve the problem (generally a model) 

5) build a report to send to the client (this report must follow the company's format and standards).

One aspect where I notice I am having difficulties or improvement are in what I will call the non-technical or non-statistical aspects of the workflow above. That is suppose you gather the right data and think about the proper methodology to solve the problem, but then how can I prevent errors on the coding and reporting, for instance:

\- you have the right methodology, but when you are coding the model you assign a wrong variable in the code in some step and then the results are not valid ( for instance you have x\_train and x\_test and you mistakenly do m = x\_test / 2 instead of m = x\_train / 2).

\- on the reporting stage, you exported the wrong results.

These are just examples.

Then you send your report and under scrutiny from your managers or revising things to answer additional questions you find this errors. Then it looks unprofessional to say that the initial results were wrong and you will have to update it. It may not inspire much confidence in your results in the future.

It has been hard for me to find ways to improve in this aspect because these types of errors are hard to predict. When you are coding you are already doing what you think it is correct. Given the time frames we have, it is also unfeasible to double check every single line of code. Also, the problems are generally very diverse in nature, so it is not like you can just adopt an automated or semi-automated methodology that you can work upon and improve, many things you have to build from scratch every time you receive a new project.

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I work as a data-scientist in a junior position. My typical workflow consist of the following steps :&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1) the client gives us a problem &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2) think about proper methodology &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3) gather the data necessary to solve the problem &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4) apply some statistical procedures to solve the problem (generally a model) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;5) build a report to send to the client (this report must follow the company&amp;#39;s format and standards).&lt;/p&gt;

r/datascience,"I am currently a Lead Data Scientist at a large defense contractor, primarily applying data science solutions to business-facing homerooms. Think supply chain, business management, etc. 

A few highlights about me...

* Very strong SQL skills, and I have done a large amount of data ETL
* Moderately strong Python skills
* Top 1% on Stack Overflow (I answer a lot of SQL and Python questions, also ask some)
* Nearly 10 internal Trade Secrets awarded to products I have built
* B.S. in Information Technology, I am graduating in August with my M.S. in Computer Science w/ an AI concentration from Hopkins
* About 3.5 years of work experience out of undergrad, two internships at Defense contractors before that
* Also have security related certifications (Security+)
* I mentor both the cybersecurity and AI clubs for my high school (along with a few other alumni)

I was contacted on LinkedIn by a recruiter. I have never really had an intention of working at FAANG organizations. From what I have read both on Reddit and elsewhere, the ""work 7 days a week"" and high pressure culture doesn't fit what I am really looking for. However, the recruiter mentioned almost 60% more than I make now, so that was enticing.

I feel technically sound -- but I definitely don't know how succinctly I could give an answer to some technical questions. I've looked at:

r/datascience,"As we know, EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) is a very common procedure in the field. We use it mainly to find inconsistencies in the data, to uncover simple patterns that could alter our perceptions of what we are dealing with and to build insightful visualizations. I think we can all agree how this type of information can be critical. What I would like to do here, and I hope you bear with me, is to question what seems to me a overly optimistic application of this technique.

So, a little context. I've been working on a small consultant startup that leverage data science techniques to serve our costumers. As you can probably guess, most of our services involve helping our clients make sense of their data and extract useful information that can maximize their profits. 

In the project I'm in, for 3 months we have been doing EDA and communicating our results through Power Point presentations. Although sometimes we could find something that was potentially interesting, this experience left me questioning the value of EDA when applied in isolation. 

To explicit my argument, let's go through an example: suppose I have a database with 20 variables and my goal is to find ""something interesting"". What we usually do is trying to find correlations between these variables (be it in form of graphs of statistical tests). Suppose that I find a positive correlation between X and Y, though. What is this really saying to me? How is this accounting for confounding variables and how much variance is it capturing? My bosses don't seem to me very concerned with these questions and usually think the finding of a correlation is already an insightful thing to communicate. 

I have been trying to argument with them that no analysis could be detached from previsibility. If this variable is correlated with the outcome, but it isn't helping to predict it, then why are we so focused on it? My concerns are usually met with the same answers: ""it is important to visualize what is happening"", ""we are still exploring our data"". 

This makes me think that my approach (predictability in the first place) is kind of unusual in the field? It appears to me that EDA has became a branch of data science that is not connecting very well with everything and is becoming embedded in some other kind of rules?

r/datascience,"I work as an Analytics Manager and normally I don't really share with my colleagues the in depth details of my work because nobody is technical. They just know I use SQL and Python to spit out a report and that's all they really understand.

Recently I had an opportunity to do something interesting where I had a very skewed data set and was asked to make sense of it. I thought applying a log transformation to normalize the data as the distribution was extremely skewed and thought it would make the data easier to interpret and I was happy with the results.

My colleagues wanted to know how I arrived at my conclusion for my recommendation so I walked them through the process. I provided a high level overview, but they really wanted to get into the nitty gritty of exactly HOW I got to where I got. Again, I normally don't like to do this because they tend ask very detailed questions like ""Can you explain exactly how this works so I can understand?"" and it gets tough to explain certain things (e.g., I would say something like ""I got this raw data from the API"" but then it's followed up by a question like ""What is an API and why didn't you just use the vendor's dashboard? Why doesn't the vendor's interface provide the data? Why do you have to go through this step?"").

Well anyway I was explaining my logic and really tip toed around the stats by really trying to say essentially that I applied some logic that would more even distribute the data. I stupidly said the word ""log"" and it was over. Their faces froze for a good 10 seconds before someone spoke.

""I'm sorry..but what? What is log? Why do you need this log? I'm really confused. How am I suppose to explain this to the SVP? Can you just change it so you're indexing off the median or mean? This doesn't make any sense.""

I'm dead.

So guys, how do you avoid getting away with having to explain things by  not using technical jargon? I mean like I said, I normally just show people the output of my report and I don't get too many in depth questions about it, but when people really pry, it gets tough. I don't know how to avoid saying ""I ran a regression model"" because it freaks people out and they get upset because they don't understand it and want me to do something that is easier to interpret. It's already frustrating that they think I'm over complicating things by using Python instead of Excel, but I can at least tell them certain things like Excel can't handle 1+ million rows and they can understand that.

EDIT: Hey all, appreciate all you feedback, both positive and negative. I think it's all constructive. There's a lot of replies in this thread so it's hard to answer everyone's questions. Some of you ask the same things and I do answer them, but you might have to dig through the comments to find it. In any case, let me post some frequently asked ones:

1) Did you use graphs and visuals?

Answer: I did. I actually stayed away from using the word log at first and just showed them a histogram of what the data looked like before the log transform and then after the log transform. What followed up was ""How did you do this? What did you use to index the numbers?"" And that's when I mentioned I used a log transformation.

2) How did you explain what a log transform was?

Answer: I didn't directly explain it in math terms. I described it in the form of an analogy or comparable example. This is what I said: 

""Imagine we were looking at salaries for a company. Most people for example will make a salary between something like $40 - 100k right? Well what if the top execs in the company make like $10 million dollars. Now imagine you tried to index using the mean? Wouldn't the mean say the average employee at this company makes a salary of $1 million dollars or something? That's not right. Basically, a log transformation would keep everyone's differences in consideration, but minimize the importance of some of those execs who are not entirely representative of the rest of the company. That way you can better see the difference in salary among every worker and not have your vision obscured by some of these execs who are throwing off that balance. ""

Unfortunately, this proved to be even more confusing and my colleagues really zoned in on exactly what a log was and how it's calculated and it was tough to navigate from there.

r/datascience,"**It's Friday, lets vent!**

Will share my story but heavily changed to protect the guilty.  

I work(ed) in a safety field where people die based on decisions. We risk rate things, and use our limited resources to prioritise what we need to fix. For arguments sake, I have put this in the context of safety of vehicles.

Someone in another department came up with a subjective but otherwise understandable way of risk rating. Things  like 

* if there are seatbelts, subtract 1
* add the number of accidents in the last year
* if there is speed monitoring, subtract 1
* if no licence is required, add 2
* subtract 1 for every time they have been inspected  


As you can see, some of these were real numbers, some ordinal, some categorical and so on.

These numbers are added to give a final ""risk"" score for a vehicle. So far, so dodgy.

However, this total ""number"" was then ranked, and then multiplied by the number of passengers to give an overall value, which was then multiplied by the amount of safety dollars we had to spend to work out what we should do.

r/datascience," 

I am currently wanting to construct predictive models to identify patients who may have a misdiagnosis of a certain disease. However, the issue is that I have multiple databases and I do not want to combine the data into one set, so I need to create predictive models for each database. On top of that, I wanted to use different model approaches and use the most accurate model.  

I'm currently facing the problem of determining a way to identify the optimal decision threshold to categorize the results of the predictive model as having been misdiagnosed (p=1) or not having been misdiagnosed (p=0). I've read about how we can use Youden's Index to determine the optimal cutoff for a model, but since I'll have multiple models for each of the database, would it make sense to use the SAME cuttoff across all the models and databases or have one for each database (but keep it consistent for each model within the database)? I'm a bit lost on what the best approach is. I haven't been able to find papers that provide detail on how they determine optimal decision thresholds when they have multiple models

P.S. I've read about how you can use the cost of each result (i.e., TP, TN, FP, FN) to determine the threshold, but these values are unknown for my disease of interest. 

Sorry about the long post, and thank you for your help in advance!",t2_15hc7q,How to determine the one optimal decision threshold across multiple predictive models,projects,t3_gpibk8,0.88,6,Projects,6,1590318556.0,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am currently wanting to construct predictive models to identify patients who may have a misdiagnosis of a certain disease. However, the issue is that I have multiple databases and I do not want to combine the data into one set, so I need to create predictive models for each database. On top of that, I wanted to use different model approaches and use the most accurate model.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m currently facing the problem of determining a way to identify the optimal decision threshold to categorize the results of the predictive model as having been misdiagnosed (p=1) or not having been misdiagnosed (p=0). I&amp;#39;ve read about how we can use Youden&amp;#39;s Index to determine the optimal cutoff for a model, but since I&amp;#39;ll have multiple models for each of the database, would it make sense to use the SAME cuttoff across all the models and databases or have one for each database (but keep it consistent for each model within the database)? I&amp;#39;m a bit lost on what the best approach is.

r/datascience,"Hello,

I've been hearing polarising opinions on using using Jupyter notebooks in production. My read is that people generally agree on notebooks being useful for exploratory analysis, but the path from there to production seems very vague and very different for different workflows.

Here is what I've found quite useful for my team, made of data analysts, data scientists and me as production engineer. We start from notebooks and gradually end up with code in .py files. It usually involves a hybrid setup of Jupyter web UI and VsCode connected remotely to SageMaker machine, opening the same dir notebooks are in.

There is not quantitative data to back it up, but I feel it didn't decrease the iteration speed and it definitely avoids a lot of ""translation"" from what they write into production code.

What are your thoughts on this?

Do you do something similar?

Is your data setup so complex that it's almost impossible to move from notebook to the production code?

RSS feed readers ingest content and republish it with credit to the author. This step gives the author added exposure, like how radio stations offer musicians free advertising to sell their music.

Examples of news aggregators include Google News, Drudge Report, Huffington Post, Fark, Zero Hedge, Newslookup, Newsvine, World News (WN) Network and Daily Beast, where the aggregation is entirely automatic

I see that the automated algorithm was incorrectly listing the admin as the author on some of the articles, but there was no intent to deceive. If you look, you will see that EVERY ITEM had the ""ORIGINAL SOURCE"" listed at the bottom of EACH ARTICLE, and that linked to the ORIGINAL AUTHOR. One more time: If you look, you will see that EVERY ITEM had the ""ORIGINAL SOURCE"" listed at the bottom of each piece that then linked to the ORIGINAL AUTHOR.

There was no intent to claim ownership. If so, it was a pretty hair-brained try, but I apologize to anyone who feels deserving.

Since I have no financial gain from this site, and no good deed goes unpunished, I decided to take it down. I don't need the aggravation to share useful content and authors if the reward is getting attacked.

I am an awarding winning researcher, as published in at least two national magazines. I don't need anybody else's credibility.

Many articles picked up by the RSS feeds I would be embarrassed to publish under my name.

I am confident that NOBODY, with a clue about data science, thought someone was writing hundreds of articles a week. Especially when posting the ORIGINAL SOURCE, and it links to the ORIGINAL AUTHOR at the bottom of each piece! Seriously!? SERIOUSLY!!!?

I've not made a penny from the site, nor have I ever tried (or wanted to). It was built as a news aggregator to promote the work of others and create a place to stay up to date without navigating to hundreds of sources (yes hundreds). That IS what news aggregators do! I received many thank you notes from authors happy to have extra exposure.

I apologize for my oversite in the way the aggregation algorithm posted. In hindsight, I wish the ""Original Source and Author"" link was on the top rather than the bottom (besides a few other items). I assure you my intent was genuinely excellent; I was trying to give those interested a convenient news aggregation a resource.

I don't create excuses, but please, it is sophomoric to jump from unintentional RSS feed read result to first-degree murder.

Trust me; if anybody worth their weight in Data Science thought you or anybody else got fooled by something so obvious, they would likely think you were in the wrong profession. I asked my 7th-grade daughter to read a few articles and then decipher who the source and author were, and she had NO PROBLEM correctly identifying them (hint, it was not me). I'm pretty sure you can relax.

Again, look at all the ORIGINAL SOURCES and AUTHORS linked to in every case.

I will use the site for personal purposes to save my own time; it got built as my individual RSS reader; I will return it to that.

I apologize to those authors and readers that were happy I had put in the work to create the content aggregation location and add more exposure to others' work. (with zero pay to me)

If you intended to be disruptive, trolling, punitive, and silencing, congratulations, job well done, not worth my time anymore. Honestly, I was getting a little tired of putting in the work anyway. Feel free to navigate the hundreds of sources on your own (yes hundreds); it should only take you 10 or 12 hours a day.

See what I did there? I posted a link with a bit of an explanation. That's fine. If you want to know more, you have to go to their content on their site. We all do that in our social media feeds. Putting all their content on my site so readers don't need to go to theirs is theft. It doesn't matter if I put the attribution somewhere with the post. No permission=theft.

When another site wants to repost something I've written, they send me a message and ask for permission. That's been the way it is done for the eight years I have been writing. With a site like KDNuggets, I am always good with giving them the OK and not asking for compensation. Some major outlets will ask me to rebuild a post to appeal to their target audience. They have millions of readers. I do that for free too.

I have worked with consulting companies. They want content to drive people to their site as a form of organic marketing. It's usually pretty fluffy, buzzword bingo type posts. I get paid for that. If someone is advertising their services on the site, they are making money off that site and you should too.

I have worked with companies that make products. They want technical content to explain how to use their product in the real world. Again, they use that content to market their products. I get paid for that and you should too.

In the research world, works are cited. There can be a longer quotation from the original work which will have the primary authors' names next to it. Supporting works without quotes will be linked to at the end of the research paper. That's fine. Copy paste research, paraphrasing, releasing implementations as original works, all of that is plagiarism. That gets you blacklisted.

I have posted content that was very close to someone else's. They posted first. I issued an apology and a link to their content. It happens.

Hi,

My girlfriend is a 22 year old university student passionate about data science, and she just posted my first article on Medium using Machine-Learning (that took her months of research and coding to put together). Her post only has about 500 views, but to her surprise today a reddit user called [**Dean-Hoffman**](https://www.reddit.com/user/Dean-Hoffman/) **posted a link to his own data science company where he copy-pasted her article.** He didn't contact her about reposting it, didn't give her proper credit and **ridiculously added a ""Contact Data Scientist"" at the end with his name on it**. On the article, he clearly stated he is the author in multiple locations. This is the ""Data Science"" company that links from the article on his website: [https://www.actionablelabs.com/](https://www.actionablelabs.com/)

Apparently the guy Dean Hoffman is the ""founder"" of the company and refers to himself on the About Us as **""offering the highest commitment to excellence, personal integrity, and business ethics.""**

Update: Hey, this is the girlfriend that wrote the article. First of all, thank you all that made the time to reply, research and help me find answers. It's really appreciated.  So far, this is what we know about this person (or people):

\- This website has been stealing hundreds, if not thousands, of data science projects and articles from legitimate data scientists and writers.

\- The stolen content website in definitely bot-operated as the owner posts dozens of articles a day, completely copy+paste, mainly from Medium, TechCrunch and Towards Data Science.

\- It's confirmed that Dean-Hoffman from the Linkedin that links from his company (Actionable Labs) is a real person and the same Dean-Hoffman that is stealing content and running a data company.

\- If you go on his linkedin, under ""Data Scientist - Pennsylvania Department of General Services"" you will find that he mentions ""Actionable Insights"" (the stolen content website) in one of his experiences. Completely absurd.

UPDATE 2: Medium and TDS unfortunately can't do much for me individually as the authors are the ones who own the rights to the articles. TDS will try to reach out to the owner and ask them to take the posts down. I hope they see that their whole website is being copied, which would most likely infringe their TOS.

Please don't comment anything that contains the words ""copyright"", ""infringement"" or related words on her article as it may trigger keyword algorithms that delete copyrighted articles posted to Medium (and thus could have her article deleted). Thank you!

Hello everyone! 

I'm a DS working at an important Bank in my country. Here I've been dealing with solving problems with unstructured data, like videos, images and text. It's being interesting, but I feel quite unsatisfied. I mean, I studied economics and I'm doing a MSc in Statistics. I love time series in a theoretical way, since I can't find a job that works with them. 

I thought that working at a bank would be cool and have some forecast related projects I could work on... but I couldn't work on any.  

You see in my department there are many areas for data analysis, but not for data modeling, except mine and other. The other area makes churn models, and sometimes recommendation systems. 

I feel I'm taking a wrong path for my future. I have no finance related experience (images, text?) Neither time series Modelling experience (aside from the theoretical one). 

I want to change and I recently found a position at the bank that deals with Risk and I think I might go for it (it's no time series related, but is bank related).  But my boss and the director of the area I work on don't want me to move. They say they really like my work, and that we have many projects we can work on, particularly since my area is gaining a lot of credibility. 

I don't know what to do. I'm not sure if the position in Risk involves modelling and predicting as much as I'd like, or if it will just be analyzing and giving back raw numbers. 

Should I stay and keep looking for TS related jobs, or change to the Risk to gain insights and learn from the bank duties and may find place for forecasting? Should I just take this, grow in this side and hope to find something in the future?

r/datascience,"I ran in to this problem trying to build a model to predict loan defaulters using credit history features. A few of the features are of the format ""number of months since X"" where X could be the borrower's last late payment, last account of a particular type opened, etc. Some of these seem like they could be strong features, but have many missing values (with good reason). For instance, ""months since last delinquency"" feature only applies to those borrowers which have a delinquency on their record. Imputing a value of 0 would imply those with no delinquencies are the same as those with an extremely recent delinquency, and imputing a very large value (say 9999) just doesn't sit right with me. My only other idea was to introduce an ordinal feature instead of a numeric one, binning delinquency recency by say ""never"", ""&lt;1 year"", ""1-2 years"", ""3-4 years"" etc. The issue I have with that is I would be deciding the cut off points at the expense of granularity, while it may be better to let the module ""learn"" those cutoff points.

Imputing a value of 0 would imply those with no delinquencies are the same as those with an extremely recent delinquency, and imputing a very large value (say 9999) just doesn&amp;#39;t sit right with me. My only other idea was to introduce an ordinal feature instead of a numeric one, binning delinquency recency by say &amp;quot;never&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;&amp;lt;1 year&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;1-2 years&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;3-4 years&amp;quot; etc. The issue I have with that is I would be deciding the cut off points at the expense of granularity, while it may be better to let the module &amp;quot;learn&amp;quot; those cutoff points.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

r/datascience,"Coming from the engineering field where the main artefacts of work are source code and production systems, I sometimes feel a bit short in processes around organising and saving the work my team does.

I've noticed there are several types of projects:

* once off data analysis
* exploration that leads to a feature shipped in a product
* explorations that never get shipped
* data analysis for debugging purposes. Let's say we run an A/B test and want to figure out whether we set it up correctly. We won't really share results outside of the team.

I guess different project will possibly get different answers, but let's kick off with these questions:

* where do you store the sidecar data? We store the code on GitHub, but don't want to package the data with the code (security/compliance reasons)
* do you make all your explorations reproducible? For example, a piece of code calls the warehouse. Do you store the snapshot of the data somewhere so you know exactly what was analysed?
* do you store all analysis you perform? For example, exec asks you for some numbers for a PPT
* do you keep track of different experiments? What do you use for that? Notion/Confluence/Gdocs/something ML specific?

r/datascience,"I need to establish a framework for formatting, matching and tracking changes to a dataset that can only be accessed through a CSV-file. I know how to do that using Excel and VBA, but I was wondering if there isn't a better way.

The problems goes:

1. The goal is to gather a weekly COMPANY : SHARES summary (could be limited to 30 pre-selected companies).
2. Twice a year I get a COMPANY : FUND overview.
3. I can pull an extensive dataset (around 54k obs) structured as FUND : SHARES, but the dataset FUND-string often also includes a lot of noise, such as the company address, company name, telephone etc.
4. To aggregate COMPANY : SHARES, I thus need to match COMPANY : FUND by scanning through the dataset FUND string and match with keywords relating to each specific company (such as a fund name, or the company's own name).
5. Because of the bad quality of the dataset, I will need to manually look at the results of the sorting to adjust the keywords for faulty matches, e.g. a new fund has been attributed because it matched with the company name keyword, but the string also includes some info which makes it clear that it shouldn't have been matched here so I include a non-match keyword filter it out from being matched with that company. This is unfortunate, but bearable as a total of \~200 funds are matched if the number of companies are limited to 30.

I know how to do streamline most of this process with some hassle using Excel Power Query for formatting and importing the CSV, VBA for for matching the data and a Pivot Table for creating a summary. I also know some Python and have SQL experience. I see how SQL would ease the sorting, but I would still need to manually download and format the CSV before feeding it into, say, MS Access. It would be so nice with a setup where I could more easily set the company match/don't-match keywords, see exactly which rows has been matched per company from the dataset, adjust keywords and re-run, and maybe even point out new matches that wasn't there last time it was run.

r/datascience,"We often see the question on this sub around ""how do I build a portfolio as a student?"", i.e., what projects should I work on?

If the resumes I've reviewed over the last 5 years are any indication, most people seem to think that the answer is a Jupyter Notebook that takes a pretty standard dataset, does EDA, builds a model, and presents a bunch of plots showing quality of fit.

From my perspective, these projects are pretty much useless. I say that because odds are that I can figure out if you can build such a notebook by just asking you a handful of questions and spending 5 minutes talking to you. Most importantly, being able to do that for a project that you chose (whether personal or capstone project) makes this project worthless in terms of helping me evaluate how you overcome obstacles - odds are that the way your overcame obstacles was by choosing a project that was easy to do and had relatively clean, available data.

So how do you make a better personal project?

**Start with a problem statement that is actually useful, even if you don't know how to solve it**

As a rule of thumb, an imperfect solution to a useful problem is better than a perfect solution to a useless one. I'd rather see you build a linear regression model to solve something that people actually care about instead of building a deep learning model to predict Titanic deaths. Why? Because problems that matter show a hiring manager that you can think through how to use data science to drive value. And if the process of getting there sends you down some windy roads, it also shows the hiring manager that you're able to navigate them. These are two *really* important skillsets.

Mind you, when I say ""useful"" I don't mean ""important"". I'm not telling you that you need to go find a cure for cancer, just to focus on something that *someone* will find a user for.

Example:

* Building a  model to optimize a fantasy football lineup.

Again, not important - just useful.

**Focus on a problem that goes beyond predicting a single metric**

A lot of data science ""side projects"" that I see focus on predicting a single quantity. While sometimes you will find yourself doing that in a work setting, most of the time your work goes beyond that, meaning you are normally predicting a quantity so that you can then influence a decision process, or estimate a broader outcome, etc.

So if you're going to work on a side project, try to follow through your model ""all the way"", i.e., through to an actual outcome that could be useful.

Example:

* Don't just predict the number of points a player will score in fantasy football - actually build that into a model that can help someone make decisions in a more complex setting (like daily fantasy football, or evaluating draft strategies).

**Start with ugly, raw data if you can**

If you start your project with mostly clean, post-processed data you've already skipped a big step in terms demonstrating what you can do. If instead you choose to go for something that isn't in its final form, you can flex a couple of different muscles.

For example, you could scrape data. Not super complicated, but it already shows me an extra skillset. Or you could start with data in log format and writing the necessary scripts to convert it into tabular form.

Example:

* Instead of starting with aggregate NFL stats, start with NFL play-by-play logs and write a script to convert ""S.Barkley runs for 10 yard loss PENALTY Holding: NYG REJECTED"" into the appropriate statline.

**If possible, build an actual product - not just analysis**

Building a product allows you a couple of advantages. For one, it allows you to just share a link to something that people can actually use. Secondly, if your tool were to get any traffic, it allows you to validate your idea. Lastly, it allows you to flex a completely different muscle - the fact that you can think through basic (or advanced) designs and deploy a solution to an environment.

Example:

* Build a web-app where people can make selections and your tool will output a recommended lineup in fantasy football.

**Work alone**

One of the big issues with group projects outside of a work setting is that it's hard for a hiring manager to corroborate what you did personally vs. what others did. That means that some hiring managers may just choose to assume that you didn't have a part in all of it - and worse, that you don't have all of those skills.

If you work by yourself, you can guarantee that an interviewer will assume that you did all of it, and there will be no questions of what you can/cannot do.

Some may say ""but group projects show that I can work in a team!"". And I think everyone that has ever worked in a group project knows that they seldom punish the person in a group who most lazy and hardest to work with. 

Obviously this is just my opinion, but since the topic comes up often I figured it was worth putting it down to at least start a conversation.",t2_3epw0pud,What makes a good personal project - from the perspective of a hiring manager,,t3_gf9hrs,0.99,615,,615,1588896785.0,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;We often see the question on this sub around &amp;quot;how do I build a portfolio as a student?&amp;quot;, i.e., what projects should I work on?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Start with ugly, raw data if you can&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you start your project with mostly clean, post-processed data you&amp;#39;ve already skipped a big step in terms demonstrating what you can do. If instead you choose to go for something that isn&amp;#39;t in its final form, you can flex a couple of different muscles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, you could scrape data. Not super complicated, but it already shows me an extra skillset. Or you could start with data in log format and writing the necessary scripts to convert it into tabular form.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Instead of starting with aggregate NFL stats, start with NFL play-by-play logs and write a script to convert &amp;quot;S.Barkley runs for 10 yard loss PENALTY Holding: NYG REJECTED&amp;quot; into the appropriate statline.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If possible, build an actual product - not just analysis&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Building a product allows you a couple of advantages. For one, it allows you to just share a link to something that people can actually use. Secondly, if your tool were to get any traffic, it allows you to validate your idea. Lastly, it allows you to flex a completely different muscle - the fact that you can think through basic (or advanced) designs and deploy a solution to an environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Build a web-app where people can make selections and your tool will output a recommended lineup in fantasy football.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Work alone&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the big issues with group projects outside of a work setting is that it&amp;#39;s hard for a hiring manager to corroborate what you did personally vs. what others did. That means that some hiring managers may just choose to assume that you didn&amp;#39;t have a part in all of it - and worse, that you don&amp;#39;t have all of those skills.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you work by yourself, you can guarantee that an interviewer will assume that you did all of it, and there will be no questions of what you can/cannot do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some may say &amp;quot;but group projects show that I can work in a team!&amp;quot;. And I think everyone that has ever worked in a group project knows that they seldom punish the person in a group who most lazy and hardest to work with. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Obviously this is just my opinion, but since the topic comes up often I figured it was worth putting it down to at least start a conversation.&lt;/p&gt;

r/datascience,"Hi!  I'm hoping someone can help me or provide some insight.  I work with a partner agency that is hoping to improve dataset integration. Briefly, they have one system that creates a user id and documents some information (this is related to covid testing and contact tracing). There is another system they use essentially like a service management tool. It takes data from system 1 (e.g. name, phone, tested positive) and uses this additional system to document case notes and provide service work updates (e.g. patient has not exhibited symptoms in three days).

Here's the issue:  the agency is manually exporting data from system one and uploading into system two nightly.  They use SAS for this, but i'm not sure how (I've only ever used SAS for analytics like MLR, cluster analysis, etc.).  

They need a faster and less manual way to integrate the data.  Ideally when one system is updated, the other is also updated much quicker than overnight and less manually (than export, import, matching, etc.).

I don't have a lot of specifics here; my agency was just brought on to help and i do not yet have information like metric names/types, job/etl schedule, etc.

Does anyone have any experience, insight, or suggestions?  I would appreciate it!

r/datascience,"Hello everyone,

I have been working as a data analyst for about 3 years and about 2 years ago I switched to Pandas due to how much potential it had to improve my life: I am very bad at cataloging and record keeping, so doing things in Pandas makes everything so traceable and reproducible for me. Plus Excel always becomes super slow for me when the rows surpass 80K.

This week I will give my team members a quick demonstration of Pandas's capabilities. A lot of my team members use Excel for most of their data analysis, so I'd like to show them some handy operations that can be done by Pandas in much shorter time, hence improving our efficiency.

Several operations I have in mind are:

* The magic power of `unstack` to move columns into rows, usually accompanying `set_index()` and `groupby`.
* `df.duplicated()`, esp if I want to find the rows that have duplicate values in some columns, I can do `df[df.duplicated(['A', 'B'], keep=False)]`
* I always have to write a pretty long formula in Excel to find values in column A that is in or not in column B. I love how I can just do `df[~df.colA.isin(df1.colB)]`
* \`merge\` compared to `vlookup` or `indexmatch`

That's about what I have in mind right now. Some other operations like drop\_duplicates() or sum()  can be done not without too much effort in Excel. I don't think I need to talk about groupby() as we all use SQL on a regular basis.

Would anyone care to give me some additional examples please?

What kinds of presentation skills do you find most important to hone at work? What did you do to develop these skills? And finally, how do you deal with fear of public speaking?

I spend a lot of time familiarizing myself with the topic I plan to present, organizing my materials so they “tell a story”, practice giving mock presentations and try to think of questions that the audience may ask. I feel comfortable with the knowledge, but find myself freezing up once I actually have to present. I’ve always struggled with performance anxiety. My heart starts pounding, my palms get sweaty, and I start getting tunnel vision. This seems to happen regardless of how much preparation I do.

Improving on this is one of my number 1 goals over the next year or so! If you have any advice or stories to share, please do!

r/datascience,"Hi,

I have passed this week the [TensorFlow Developer Certificate](https://www.tensorflow.org/certificate) from Google. I could not find a lot of feedback here about people taking it so I am writing this post hoping it will help people who want to take it. 

The exam contains 5 problems to solve, part of the code is already written and you need to complete it.  It can last up to 5 hours, you need to upload your ID/Passport and take a picture using your webcam at the beginning, but no one is going to monitor what you do during those 5 hours. You do not need to book your exam beforehand, you can just pay and start right away. There is no restriction on what you can access to during the exam.

I strongly recommend you to take [Coursera's TensorFlow in Practice Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/tensorflow-in-practice) as the questions in the exam are similar to the exercises you can find in this course. I had previous experience with TensorFlow but anyone with a decent knowledge of Deep Learning and finishes the specialization should be capable of taking the exam.

I would say the big drawback of this exam is the fact you need to take it in Pycharm on your own laptop. I suggest you do the exercises from the Specialization using Pycharm if you haven't used it before (I didn't and lost time in the exam trying to get basic stuff working in Pycharm). I don't have GPU on my laptop and also lost time while waiting for training to be done (never more than \~10mins each time but it adds up), so if you can get GPU go for it! In my opinion it would have make more sense to do the exam in Google Colab... 

Last advice: for multiple questions the source comes from [TensorFlow Datasets](https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets), spend some time understanding the structure of the objects you get as a result from load\_data , it was not clear for me (and not very well documented either!), that's time saved during the exam.

I would be happy to answer other questions if you have some!",t2_1tx9d060,Passed TensorFlow Developer Certification,education,t3_gc29zj,0.97,400,Education,400,1588432418.0,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last advice: for multiple questions the source comes from &lt;a href=""https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets""&gt;TensorFlow Datasets&lt;/a&gt;, spend some time understanding the structure of the objects you get as a result from load_data , it was not clear for me (and not very well documented either!), that&amp;#39;s time saved during the exam.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would be happy to answer other questions if you have some!&lt;/p&gt;

r/datascience,"Hello everyone,

So a bit of backstory. I started in my current role roughly nine months ago. During the interview process I made it extremely clear I wanted a data science position (particularly one that involved a lot of machine learning) but the recruiter said there were no openings on data science. She and the others I talked with did say my role would primarily revolve around deploying models into production and not building pipelines and I could transition to data science once there became openings. I did have another full-time data science offer, however it was in a different city. Therefore, I was faced with a tough decision and based both on location and their 'promises' I chose my current role. 

However, in the first few months after starting I realized three things: (1) I wouldn't be deploying any models to production as the DS team had absolutely no models past the prototyping stage (and nine months later they still don't), (2) several others were brought onto the DS team right around when I started, (3) several of the people on DS including the DS lead seemed extremely weak in terms of actual machine learning knowledge. In retrospect this should have been a red-flag but I still hoped I could move off of data engineering and get into data science going. (Also, several of my previous roles had been on contracts, so I wanted to hold down a position for at least a year and not look like a job hopper.)

 Throughout Nov/Dec I tried unsuccessfully to get put on data science projects. This was particularly frustrating as I have expertise in several areas of modeling where the company is struggling. 

Moreover, they transferred several engineers with absolutely no DS background onto DS just because they apparently had nothing better to do with them. However, they kept promising my time would come. Finally, in Feb/Mar they brought me on to a couple of projects aimed at the knowledge graph, apparently because I was the only one in the entire organization with NLP experience. I was happy to work on that but they made it clear that my primary responsibilities for the time being were still data engineering. I asked them if they had plans to hire someone full time to data engineering so I could move over and they said yes. 

Now to the present. They tell me to stop all data science work because they want me 100% focused on data engineering. They come up with some flimsy excuse about the economy and DE needing to be my focus. They also make some references to needing to improve my data engineering performance. (My performance review was perfectly fine. Plus I made it clear to them when I was interviewing DE/ETL was not my strong suit.) Moreover, they still apparently have the resources to hire a full-time data scientist (WTF? they couldn't have hired another data engineer and transitioned me).The data science manager (who still hasn't produced one concrete ML deliverable) literally sits as the product owner of data engineering. At any point he could have prioritized hiring another data engineer so I could move over. I'm beyond frustrated that they have lied to me since day one.

r/datascience,"I work as a data scientist at a medium-sized company (with \~200 employees). I've been with the company for a little over 4 months. My salary is $90K/year in a city where the cost of living is relatively cheap. (For perspective, $1200/month for 2-bedroom-2-bathroom apartment.) I have a BI analyst as my boss and I have another boss who's a BI director.

The BI team in our office is small. Just 3 of us in the office. The issue I have is that my bosses don't understand the complexity of running a valid analysis, which is forcing me to cut corners and produce sub-par quality work. Those sub-par quality analyses then get criticized by people in other departments (e.g. finance people, data scientists in other offices, etc.) and it makes me look like an idiot.

Don't get me wrong. My bosses are hardworking, smart people. They can write complex SQL code and make stunningly beautiful Tableau dashboards. However, they don't have any statistical background to properly design studies and go through the proper procedures to come to accurate conclusions. But they care too much about how beautiful the presentations must be (font, color, company branding, etc.) and meeting deadlines instead of focusing on the important stuffs, like valid experimental procedures and properly separating out correlation from causation.

I would say that the overall company culture is very healthy. The CEO is super transparent about the company matters. Everyone is very open and caring. The company sent a lot of care packages during the quarantine for the employees and they also host weekly fun company-wide activities. They give great medical and health benefits as well as PTO.

I thought about quitting because not having enough time and resources that I need to do my job is making me look incompetent. I haven't quit yet because:

1. I don't think many other companies are hiring amid this quarantine crisis,
2. I have a criminal background so I'm not sure if there is any other company that's willing to risk hiring me.

What should I do? At this rate, I'm gonna continue looking like an idiot and maybe I'll lose my job.

TLDR: My boss is not giving me enough time to do my analyses so I'm producing sub-par quality work. What should I do?

**TL;dr: DS job doesn't have ML/modelling work. Underpaid. Imposter syndrome kicking in. Want to switch jobs but afraid that I didn't build good experience to apply to bigger more challenging roles. Feeling stuck. Thinking of switching to swe since my statistics and ML growth hasn't been too good at current role. Need advice. More details below.**

I'm a data scientist, and I've been working on the same application for an year or two. I don't see it changing. Most of my experience has been writing spark code and  dev ops and cloud infra work for an application that we build. There's a bit of prototyping work here and there. And some business case development with upper management. The team is really small. And there are no senior members in the DS team. The only thing that I like about it is that I have positioned myself to become the most experienced person in the team on a product that we work on so i get to have a lot of say in the dev process.

I never go to do any ML or statistical modelling at this job. It was my first job after college, and I have severe imposter syndrome kicking in. So now I don't feel like a data scientist, and I'm becoming disillusioned with the field. My MS in data scientist is going to waste since I'm not using the ML and stats I learned. I am afraid to apply to other data science jobs since I feel that I will not be able to clear a DS interview round when it comes to describing what I've done with stats and ML and deep learning. I can study and practice sure but experience matters a lot, and if I don't have that, the only DS jobs I would be able to land in the future would be title inflated analyst roles.

I might switch to a software engineering role with maybe an ML focus because I fear I didn't build any relevant experience for the type of jobs that I want in DS but I have good experience and love writing python, plus coding in general. And I'm also tired of the lack of strong software dev practices in DS teams. I want to go somewhere where I can build things and code more than I do, with a more engineering focused team. Do you think DS jobs with actually challenging work will be harder to get into since I don't have modelling/ML experience?

My company is willing to start Green Card process, and then I'll be stuck here for a couple of years. At least my gc will process faster since processing dates for my nationality is current. It also makes staying at my current role more attractive since I don't know if newer companies would be willing to file GC straight away.

So if I want to do more reporting and communication, JavaScript maybe would be the way to go?  Anyone have an anecdote that would back that idea up, or knock that idea down?

&amp;#x200B;

Alternatively, I'm thinking about R and Julia.  Right now, I'm a data analyst who only knows how to pandas.  So maybe if I want to go more the science route, I should pick up R or Julia?  (Or: I'm thinking being able to use Shiny and ggplot would let me do more interactives/viz, so have any Pythonistas out there had their life changed by the R, in that way?  Can you tell me about it?)

&amp;#x200B;

I also just started learning bash and awk.  Any data analysis type folks (but not database admin or ETL or IT type folks), discover that learning shell scripting solved a real problem they were having?  Enough to the point that its worth it to learn well?

r/datascience,"I work for a small (~4 person) data science team within a much larger organization. The team is responsible for making two machine learning models, creating a single set of very important predicted values, and creating reporting and data validation tools relevant to those predicted values. I came on board about 4 months ago with experience in data science, systems administration, and devops. I have a strong linux background and plenty of experience with Docker and Kubernetes. 

I've been asked to improve the existing modeling pipeline. I've come up with a plan that I think is feasible given the organization's goals and (considerable) constraints, but I'm hoping to get feedback on potential pitfalls or things to add from people with more ML/dev ops experience than myself. I also thought it might be fun for this sub to think through what the ideal toolchain might be given a pretty serious set of constraints.

## Goals

- Make our pipeline more robust. No more undetected data issues or breaking commits. Automatic unit and integration tests on all commits/merge requests.
- Improve pipeline transparency and reporting. Make summary and performance statistics about each model more easily available.
- Make testing and comparing new models significantly easier. More clearly tie new model results/objects to the code that produced them.
- Make the whole pipeline run continuously and automatically (given new data or other triggers).

## Constraints

- No cloud infrastructure. Everything has to be on-prem.
- Absolutely no additional money. Zero.
- Need to keep the developer toolchain as light as possible. It has to be usable by a team with limited devops/linux experience.
- Infrastructure can be (and is) linux + Docker based, but it has to be simple enough that if I die it's easy to understand and maintain for someone with a moderate devops background. For the same reason, all infrastructure setup has to be infrastructure as code.
- Any rebuild has to be done within 6 months of one person's full time work. This includes all infrastructure setup, code refactoring, CI/CD setup, and new code.
- The pipeline/modeling itself has to be written in R.

## Tools Available

- Hardware is limited to 2 beefy SQL servers, 2 beefy Ubuntu VMs, and ~6 beefy Windows workstations. 
- We recently upgraded to GitLab Silver for the whole organization and have all the features that go along with it.

## Current Setup

This is a relatively new team that had to get something up and running quickly, so they haven't yet had the time or resources to setup a mature ML pipeline or incorporate many devops best practices. However, they're committed to improving things and making the best system possible, hence why they asked for this plan. The current pipeline is:

1. **Data extraction/processing.** Data is stored entirely in SQL and feature engineering/data extraction is done via SQL views. The view definitions are stored in GitLab. There is one SQL server that is used for both reporting and modeling. Data extraction takes a *very* long time.

2. **Modeling.** The entire pipeline is written in R and is stored in a single, large GitLab repo. Scripts are manually triggered sequentially to run the actual pipeline and modeling. Data ingest/validation, modeling, model validation, and reporting are all roughly part of the same repo. This repo has no unit testing or integration testing.

3. **Reporting.** Reporting is done via R Markdown and a set of Shiny apps that exist separately from the main modeling repo. These reporting applications pull from the same SQL server as the main modeling scripts and report on the predicted values created in the modeling step. Model performance metrics are not available to the reporting apps.

Other notes:

- Intermediate data and model objects are not saved. The model specification and performance statistics of the best performing model are saved to an excel sheet. The predicted values produced by this model are saved back to SQL.

- Testing new models and/or functional forms is done manually by editing the main repo's R code. Model outputs are not tied to specific commits or branches.

## Planned Improvements

Given my constraints, I'd like to make the following improvements:

- Disaggregate the steps of the pipeline into discrete repositories/tasks that can be individually run, tested, and worked on. Add unit testing to each of these repos that runs automatically (via GitLab CI/CD). 
- Create an R package or packages that contains widely used functions and small datasets. Also add unit testing to these repos.
- Create a separate SQL server that mirrors the original server and is used exclusively for reporting.
- Use [DVC](https://dvc.org/) and [MinIO](https://min.io/) (running in Docker on a VM) to store the intermediate data produced by each step in the pipeline as well the final model objects. This is to prevent people from needing to constantly re-run the same data ingest scripts.
- Use DVC to define clear DAGs that automate the process of running the pipeline and collecting metrics on the results. Upload model metrics to a new table in SQL.
- Again use DVC to tie model output and data to specific commits and branches.
- Using the model summary metrics in both DVC and SQL, add some sort of reporting dashboard (Tableau, Shiny) that facilitates easy comparison of different models.

Those are my immediate thoughts for improvements, but I'm curious to get this sub's take as well. Additionally, I'd love to find an ML ops mentor if someone out there is willing to teach/talk.

For some context, I have under 2 years of experience working as a Data Scientist. I have a Masters and Bachelor's degree in pretty well-known schools, but these degrees aren't actually in data science or software engineering. I came into the workforce basically straight out of Master's. I would say I'm pretty proficient in ML, SQL, and Python, but my understanding of model deployment and cloud architecture is weak since I don't have an engineering degree.

My day to day responsibilities runs wide, since it's not a big company. It's everything from data analysis, model training, A/B testing, dashboarding, etc.

Based on the above information, I'm wondering if my current base salary sounds appropriate to what what I am performing and where I'm located? Someone asked this question in cscareers subreddit, and I wanted to ask the same thing.

The reason I ask is due to what my peers seem to be making around the area. Buddies of mine from FANG are pretty vocal about making 250k straight out of college (of course, a lot of that comes from equity, but does it really matter?). I'm pretty content with my current company (our work hours are really good, like 9-5 without much stress).

r/datascience,"TLDR is at the bottom,

Some background first, I've been working for almost two years as a Junior Data Scientist at a small IoT startup in Massachusetts doing mostly big data analysis with Apache Spark, and ML research/deployment with Amazon SageMaker. With the pandemic going on, and the market the way it is, not many investors are looking to fund new rounds right now, so things are getting pretty tight. Fortunately for me, the executive team is very transparent and let me know it might be time to start looking for something more stable for the time being.

Since then I've had more than a few technical interviews, and a lot of them haven't gone very well, mainly because my SQL skills are extremely basic at best. This isn't a problem at my current company because I use Apache PySpark for everything, I run it on an EMR cluster and it's usually faster than traditional SQL. I usually try to explain Spark to potential employers when they ask me about my SQL skills, but their response is usually like ""ok great, now solve this complex SQL problem anyway"".

In my opinion, PySpark is a faster alternative to raw SQL. I feel a bit frustrated because I feel like employers don't care or believe that I'm just as effective as someone with strong SQL skills.

TLDR:

Why should I learn what in my opinion is a slower alternative (SQL) to a tool I am already skilled with (PySpark)?

Am I wrong to believe I'm as effective as someone who is strong with SQL?

Why do employers insist that I must be skilled with SQL to be a good Data Scientist, even if I explain Apache Spark to them?

# Common Responses:

Really all the responses are in one of three bins

1. You need to learn SQL so you can (\*insert thing you use SQL to do\*)

My response is that I don't, I can use Spark to do almost any SQL task.

2. Just learn SQL it's easy

Yeah, It looks like I'm going to need to do this, but it doesn't really answer my question.

3. People working on a team should all use the same technology for peer review, and so others can pick up where one left off if they leave, plus other reasons. (\*insert harsh sarcasm implying I want everyont on a potential team to switch from SQL to Spark\*)

I come from a collaborative team of scientists who use a variety of tech, from my perspective it seemed reasonable to have a team where not everyone uses the same technology. I guess this is more of a unique case than I was aware of and most companies only hire people who can use the same tech as the team they would be working on. This makes sense to me, I just didn't think it was as obvious/required as others are suggessting.

**Math:**

* Linear Algebra:
   * Udemy course:  [Become a Linear Algebra Master](https://www.udemy.com/course/linear-algebra-course/)
   * Book: [Linear Algebra Done Right](https://www.amazon.com/Linear-Algebra-Right-Undergraduate-Mathematics-ebook/dp/B00PULZWPC)
   * YouTube: [Essence of linear algebra](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDPD3MizzM2xVFitgF8hE_ab)

I've been doing exercises from the book mainly but the Udemy course helps to explain some topics which seem confusing in the book. 3Blue1Brown YT is a great supplement as it helps to visualize all the concepts which are massive for understanding topics and application of the Linear algebra. I'm through 2/3 of the class and it already helps a lot with statistics part so it's must-do if you have not learned linear algebra before  


* **Statistical Learning**
   * Book: [An Introduction to Statistical Learning with Application in R](http://faculty.marshall.usc.edu/gareth-james/ISL/data.html)
   * YouTube 1: [Data Science Analytics](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCB2p-jaoolkv0h22m4I9l9Q/videos)
   * YouTube 2: [StatQuest](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCtYLUTtgS3k1Fg4y5tAhLbw)

ITSL is a great introductory book and I'm halfway through. Well explained with great examples, lab works and exercises. The book uses R but as a part of python practice, I'm reproducing all the lab works and exercises in Python. Usually, it's challenging but I learn way more doing this. (If you'll need python codes for this book's lab works let me know and I can share) The DSA YT channel just follows the ITSL chapter by chapter so it's a great way to read the book make notes and watch their videos simultaneously. StatQuest is an alternative YT channel that explains ML concepts clearly. After I'm done with ITSL I plan to continue with a more [advanced book from the same authors](https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/ElemStatLearn/)  


**Programming**:

* I use the Dataquest Data Science path and usually, I do one-two missions per day. The program is well-structured and gives what you will need at the job, but has a small number of exercises. So when you learn something it's a good idea to get some data and practice on it. 
* Udemy: [Machine Learning A-Z](https://www.udemy.com/course/machinelearning/learn/lecture/6453704?start=0#overview)
   * I use their videos after I finish the chapter in ITSL to see how t code regressions etc. But their explanation of statistics behind models is limited and vague. Anyway, a good tutorial for coding
* Book: [Think Python](https://www.amazon.com/Think-Python-Like-Computer-Scientist-ebook/dp/B018UXJ9EQ/ref=sr_1_1?crid=2NDPR8R8GRQ8N&amp;dchild=1&amp;keywords=think+python&amp;qid=1586982845&amp;s=digital-text&amp;sprefix=think+python%2Cdigital-text%2C139&amp;sr=1-1)
   * Good intro book in python. I know the majority of concepts from this book but exercises are sweet and here and there I encounter some new topic.
* Leetcode/Hackerrank
   * Mainly for SQL practice. I spend around 40 minutes to 1 hour per day (usually 5 days per week). I can solve 70-80% of easy questions on my own. Plan to move to mediums when I'm done with Dataquest specialization.
* Projects:
   * Nothin massive yet. Mainly trying to collect, clean and organize data. Lots of you suggested getting really good at it, as usual, that's what entry-level analysts do so here I am. After a couple of days, I'm returning to my previous code to see where I can make my code more readable. Where I can replace lines of code with function not to be redundant and make more reusable code. And of course, asking for feedback. It amazes me how completely unknown people can take their time to give you comprehensive and thorough feedback! 

&amp;#x200B;

I spend 4-5 hours minimum every day on the listed activities. I'm recording time when I actually study because it helps me to reduce the noise (scrolling on Reddit, FB, Linkedin, etc.). I'm doing 25-minute cycles (25 minutes uninterrupted study than a 5-minute break). At the end of the day, I'm writing a summary of what I learned during that day and what is the plan for the next day. These practices help a lot to stay organized and really stick to the plan. On the lazy days, I'm just reminding myself how bad I will feel If I skip the day and break the streak and how much gratification I will receive If I complete the challenge. That keeps me motivated. Plus material is really captivating for me and that's another stimulus. 

What can be a good way to improve my coding, stats or math? any books, courses, or practice will you recommend continuing my journey?

Any questions, suggestions, and feedback are welcome and encouraged! :D",t2_4c0gz9q3,100-days Data Science Challenge!,education,t3_g20x47,0.98,486,Education,486,1587014085.0,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;One month ago I made &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/fisj71/from_economics_to_data_science/""&gt;this post&lt;/a&gt; about starting my curriculum for DS/ML and got lots of great advice, suggestions, and feedback. Through this month I have not skipped a single day and I plan to continue my streak for 100 days. Also, I made some changes in my &amp;quot;curriculum&amp;quot; and wanted to provide some updates and feedback on my experience. There&amp;#39;s tons of information and resources out there and it&amp;#39;s really easy to get overwhelmed (Which I did before I came up with this plan), so maybe this can help others to organize better and get started.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Math:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Linear Algebra:

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Udemy course:  &lt;a href=""https://www.udemy.com/course/linear-algebra-course/""&gt;Become a Linear Algebra Master&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Book: &lt;a href=""https://www.amazon.com/Linear-Algebra-Right-Undergraduate-Mathematics-ebook/dp/B00PULZWPC""&gt;Linear Algebra Done Right&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been doing exercises from the book mainly but the Udemy course helps to explain some topics which seem confusing in the book. 3Blue1Brown YT is a great supplement as it helps to visualize all the concepts which are massive for understanding topics and application of the Linear algebra. I&amp;#39;m through 2/3 of the class and it already helps a lot with statistics part so it&amp;#39;s must-do if you have not learned linear algebra before  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Statistical Learning&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Book: &lt;a href=""http://faculty.marshall.usc.edu/gareth-james/ISL/data.html""&gt;An Introduction to Statistical Learning with Application in R&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;YouTube 1: &lt;a href=""https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCB2p-jaoolkv0h22m4I9l9Q/videos""&gt;Data Science Analytics&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;YouTube 2: &lt;a href=""https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCtYLUTtgS3k1Fg4y5tAhLbw""&gt;StatQuest&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ITSL is a great introductory book and I&amp;#39;m halfway through. Well explained with great examples, lab works and exercises. The book uses R but as a part of python practice, I&amp;#39;m reproducing all the lab works and exercises in Python. Usually, it&amp;#39;s challenging but I learn way more doing this. (If you&amp;#39;ll need python codes for this book&amp;#39;s lab works let me know and I can share) The DSA YT channel just follows the ITSL chapter by chapter so it&amp;#39;s a great way to read the book make notes and watch their videos simultaneously. StatQuest is an alternative YT channel that explains ML concepts clearly. After I&amp;#39;m done with ITSL I plan to continue with a more &lt;a href=""https://web.stanford.edu/%7Ehastie/ElemStatLearn/""&gt;advanced book from the same authors&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Programming&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I use the Dataquest Data Science path and usually, I do one-two missions per day. The program is well-structured and gives what you will need at the job, but has a small number of exercises. So when you learn something it&amp;#39;s a good idea to get some data and practice on it. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Udemy: &lt;a href=""https://www.udemy.com/course/machinelearning/learn/lecture/6453704?start=0#overview""&gt;Machine Learning A-Z&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I use their videos after I finish the chapter in ITSL to see how t code regressions etc. But their explanation of statistics behind models is limited and vague. Anyway, a good tutorial for coding&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Book: &lt;a href=""https://www.amazon.com/Think-Python-Like-Computer-Scientist-ebook/dp/B018UXJ9EQ/ref=sr_1_1?crid=2NDPR8R8GRQ8N&amp;amp;dchild=1&amp;amp;keywords=think+python&amp;amp;qid=1586982845&amp;amp;s=digital-text&amp;amp;sprefix=think+python%2Cdigital-text%2C139&amp;amp;sr=1-1""&gt;Think Python&lt;/a&gt;

r/datascience,"I am working as a Machine Learning dev on an NLP project in the Aerospace industry. To give professional context, prior to this most of my ML work so far has been with structured numerical, ordinal, or categorical data from 3D simulations &amp; video games and NLP is somewhat new to me. 

Specifically the goal is the following

1. Users take a picture of standardized work specifications with a custom app on their phones and then an OCR technology recognizes the text in the picture. (The OCR tech is already working)
2. A custom NLP tech classifies the text in the picture into specific classes and then populates a form in the app with the recognized text.

I am working on the NLP side and trying to decide which word embedding to use. The corpus for this project have meanings that are very specific to an Aerospace context (for example ""ceiling"" would relate to almost exclusively to the maximum altitude of an aircraft and NOT walls/floor/etc. ) and the amount of unique words on the work orders is likely no more than 2500-4000.

BERT's bidirectional approach seems like it would lead in general to accurate understanding of context, but I'm wondering if the pre-trained BERT models would be far too general an application like this where the context is ultra-specific.

My question is, how do I interpret this in the real world? My boss is going to say, 'great but what does that tell me about how I should run the business?' and to be honest, I haven't got a clue.

My dataset has 8 features, which I reduced to 3D in order to make the analysis work. However, that leaves me with a 3D scatter plot that looks nice but I can't relate it back to the 8 features I started with.

r/datascience,"I'm currently a data scientist at a big tech company, about 2 years in after a career change in my mid 20s. My current job is about as close to my dream job as it gets. I work on interesting problems and I genuinely enjoy the work. I'm concerned about my career path and am considering switching to software engineer for a few reasons:

1. I only have a bachelor's degree. It's a **solid** bachelors degree (computer science and stats from an ivy), but a bachelor nonetheless. Literally every data science manager i can think of has at least a master's. I'm confident that I *could* make progress at my current company, but at places like google they won't even hire a data scientist without a masters. I'm paying down lots of student debt right now and couldn't dream of going another 100k in the hole. From what I can tell, software engineering doesn't have this hard education cutoff.
2. I write next to no production code. I crank out analyses using jupyter notebooks and SQL like my hair is on fire, but only my final recommendations are seen. Combining this with a recent influx of MBAs into the field, I worry that I'm on track to a not-so-technical career path. Like consultant or something. Not necessarily bad, but I fell in love with writing code before I was a data scientist.
3. The big advances in analytics seem to be coming from building platforms, services, etc. I think I'm naturally inclined to build things and I enjoy this kind of work. Down the road, the combination of these two kinds of data science (business-focus and engineering-focused ) would give me a huge leg up.

Should I make the jump? I'm in my early 30s and I'm just not jazzed about dropping a mortgage down payment for another degree just for the ability to advance. I'd rather leverage what I've learned as a data scientist as a leg up on a career path that doesn't have the same barrier to entry.

# Intuition

Once upon a time, there was a task given (this was a decade back when excel &amp; vlookup were the 2 of 3 famous terms in the world of analytics).  
As the story goes… this was for a retail industry, we did some analytics around the products that customers are purchasing. 1. What are the products they are looking at &amp; searching? 2. What are the commonalities, pattern, segmentation etc etc.  
End of the day, we had to analyse hundreds of thousands of transactions; thousands of people, their purchase and invoices;

We found an interesting pattern happening very often. When people shop in the evening between 6 and 9. **Customers who buy diapers also buy beer**.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/syeee0ym4rs41.png?width=1081&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=80befea480ce0ec2391ebfdbed336a776433e30b

But, this insight was like out of the blue completely as these 2 products are completely not connected.  
***Why would somebody buy beer when they’re buying diapers or why buy diapers when they’re buying beer!!!***  
So that was the fact we came across in the data and the explanations as fact. **One of the plausible explanations we gave;** In the evenings, when the husband gets home and when they take care of their baby; they sometimes find that they run out of diapers and who has to go pick up the diapers.. well, the husband.

# Problem Statement

When we go grocery shopping, we often have a standard list of things to buy. Each shopper has a distinctive list, depending on one’s needs and preferences. A housewife might buy healthy ingredients for a family dinner, while a bachelor might buy beer and chips. Understanding these buying patterns can help to increase sales in several ways. If there is a pair of items, X and Y, that are frequently bought together:  
*Both X and Y can be placed on the same shelf, so that buyers of one item would be prompted to buy the other.*  
*Promotional discounts could be applied to just one out of the two items.*  
*Advertisements on X could be targeted at buyers who purchase Y.*  
*X and Y could be combined into a new product, such as having Y in flavors of X.*

Association rules are “if-then rules” with two measures which quantify the support and confidence of the rule for a given data set. Having their origin in market basket analysis, association rules are now one of the most popular tools in data mining. This popularity is to a large part due to the availability of efficient algorithms. The first and arguably most influential algorithm for efficient association rule discovery is Apriori.

**Besides increasing sales profits, association rules can also be used in other fields. In medical diagnosis for instance, understanding which symptoms tend to co-morbid can help to improve patient care and medicine prescription.**  
Folks from healthcare industry, are you reading this ?

# Definition

Association rules analysis is a technique to uncover how items are associated to each other. There are three common ways to measure association.

1. **Support:**  
This says how popular an itemset is, as measured by the proportion of transactions in which an itemset appears. In Table 1 below, the support of {apple} is 4 out of 8, or 50%. Itemsets can also contain multiple items. For instance, the support of {apple, beer, rice} is 2 out of 8, or 25%.

2. **2. Confidence:**  
This will highlight how likely item Y is purchased when item X is purchased, expressed as {X -&gt; Y}. This is measured by the proportion of transactions with item X, in which item Y also appears. In diagram below, the confidence of {apple -&gt; beer} is 3 out of 4, or 75%.

**3. Lift:**  
Table below how likely item Y is purchased when item X is purchased, while controlling for how popular item Y is. In diagram below, the lift of {apple -&gt; beer} is 1,which implies no association between items. A lift value greater than 1 means that item Y is likely to be bought if item X is bought, while a value less than 1 means that item Y is unlikely to be bought if item X is bought.

**Association Rule Mining**  
Now that we understand how to quantify the importance of association of products within an itemset, the next step is to generate rules from the entire list of items and identify the most important ones. This is not as simple as it might sound. Supermarkets will have hundred of thousands of different products in store. After some simple calculations, it can be shown that just 10 products will lead to 57000 rules!! And this number increases exponentially with the increase in number of items.  
Finding lift values for each of these will get computationally very very expensive. How to deal with this problem? How to come up with a set of most important association rules to be considered? Apriori algorithm comes to our rescue for this.

**Lets build an efficient recommendation system in R studio**

1. Load data
2. Install apriori
3. Data pre-processing | Decode sparse matrix | Plot
4. Train &amp; Test
5. Visualize

In this example, we will work on a sample dataset from a grocery store, understand the business problem, and ways to optimize the sales using apriori algorithm leveraging machine learning.

&lt;h1&gt;Intuition&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once upon a time, there was a task given (this was a decade back when excel &amp;amp; vlookup were the 2 of 3 famous terms in the world of analytics).&lt;br/&gt;
As the story goes… this was for a retail industry, we did some analytics around the products that customers are purchasing. 1. What are the products they are looking at &amp;amp; searching? 2. What are the commonalities, pattern, segmentation etc etc.&lt;br/&gt;
End of the day, we had to analyse hundreds of thousands of transactions; thousands of people, their purchase and invoices;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We found an interesting pattern happening very often. When people shop in the evening between 6 and 9. &lt;strong&gt;Customers who buy diapers also buy beer&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://preview.redd.it/syeee0ym4rs41.png?width=1081&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=80befea480ce0ec2391ebfdbed336a776433e30b""&gt;https://preview.redd.it/syeee0ym4rs41.png?width=1081&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=80befea480ce0ec2391ebfdbed336a776433e30b&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, this insight was like out of the blue completely as these 2 products are completely not connected.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Why would somebody buy beer when they’re buying diapers or why buy diapers when they’re buying beer!!!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
So that was the fact we came across in the data and the explanations as fact. &lt;strong&gt;One of the plausible explanations we gave;&lt;/strong&gt; In the evenings, when the husband gets home and when they take care of their baby; they sometimes find that they run out of diapers and who has to go pick up the diapers.. well, the husband. The wife sends husband to go pick up the diapers and &lt;strong&gt;while he is picking up the diapers because its already after work hours, he also picks up some beer. Right.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And this plausible explanation might be logical or not be. This is something you can’t really think of it just by yourself but that comes from the data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I’ve highlighted this in my previous &lt;a href=""https://medium.com/@karthik.thandapani/a-beginners-guide-to-understanding-recommendation-system-f6c0054dfb7c?source=friends_link&amp;amp;sk=70c9b7177a1e731b3c742aca26ae22e7""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;post&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, based on certain insights derived from data; a supermarket or retail industry can decide how to arrange products in your shelf &lt;strong&gt;whether you run an e-commerce store to rank &amp;amp; show your products in your virtual shelf or a superstore to put these 2 products to entice people while shopping.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Here's the list without all the intro BS. Please do comment if you have some items to add! :

# Chapter 1 : General Structure

* Is there an established map of the database?
* Is it visible to all users?
* Is there a public strategy of how it is tested for truth?
* Are there known party(ies) responsible for updating it when there are structural changes?
* How often is it updated?
* When is the next scheduled update?
* Is there a change log to track prior changes?
* Is there a group of humans you can go to with questions?
* Is there a group of humans you can go to with general conversational topics?
* The user list from a DBA is great for this.
* Consider having a monthly meeting and yearly summit per database. Remember, this is YOUR responsibility. Not the owner of the database.
* If the source of data is an application or form, is there a map from every entry field to the corresponding field in the database?
* Capacity / Uptime
* How concerned should you be with locking up the database with poorly written queries?
* Who do you go to when it is dead?
* Is the data backed up / archived anywhere?
* For how long?
* Do you remove old values from the production database after archiving?
* Are queries logged?
* How often is the database refreshed, if it is part of an ETL?
* Automatically check, at the appropriate time, if it has been updated. Have a plan in place for when it is inevitably not updated.
* What is the official way to request access to the database?
* Is there a time-out process of old user ID’s?
* Have a plan in place for when an automated procedure’s stored credentials are suddenly invalid.

**Tables**

* Is there any rhyme or reason to the naming of tables?
* If there are very similar tables (ie. CUSTOMER, CUSTOMER\_NEW, CUSTOMER\_NEW\_NEW), do the alternates need to exist?
* Is this table “one row that is constantly kept updated” or “one row for each time the data changes”?

**Joins**

* Should there be at least one “Child” for every “Parent”?
* Is there a maximum expected “Children” for every “Parent”?
* Should there be “Children” who don’t have “Parents”?
* Is every table relatable to every other table?
* On joining fields
* Do the field types match, or do you need to do a conversion?
* Queries / Processes
* Is the query properly notated?
* With the code removed, the notes should be copy and paste-able to a non-technical business partner.
* The notes should represent reality. Please.
* Is it possible to do an “anti-query”?
* Reverse your filters, but mirror your production process. In high value pipelines, this can be a huge preventative measure for errors, and an easy way to provide “free” extra value.
* Is it possible to do the query by hand on a small subset of records?
* If so, do this periodically. Seriously. I know you got into this line of business to not do this stuff manually, but doing this periodically can help verify all systems are working properly.
* Is the process entirely automated?
* If not, don’t launch.
* This includes any of the tests below that say “periodically”, if possible.
* Is it possible to store the results of every query, along with a timestamp of run (especially as part of an ETL process?)
* Are you choosing a “whitelist” approach, or a “blacklist” approach?
* If there are changes after launch — will you be applying those changes to previous projects, or leaving them in place with old (and potentially inaccurate) data?

# Chapter 2 : Data Types

**All / General**

* Are null values allowed?
* Are the fields expected to change over time? If the answer is “no”, take hashes of lines at the time of development and test periodically to see if they change. If the answer is “yes”, take extracts with timestamps in the name and only use those (instead of production) for reproducibility.
* Expert level — Create a X / Y grid of every field against every other field. Have all parties involved in development (especially the humans that are the source of the data) write assumptions and rules that come up in each cell (if this field is “beer” this other field should be “$5.99”) Document all of these. If something looks wrong and the customer says “that’s ok”, DOCUMENT THIS. With audio evidence if possible. Video isn’t bad either.

**General Text (Free entry)**

* If there is a default size, why is the default size set to the size it is?
* Is the field having an identity crisis — does it only contain integers, dates, locations, etc.? If so — should it be converted to the correct type? What do you do with those that can’t be converted?
* Does the text contain invisible characters that will cause it to print strangely (line-break)?
* Does the text contain special (or international) characters? Should it? If you are planning on exporting to .csv downstream, are you removing commas upstream (or tabs, or pipes, etc.).
* Is there a list of “stop words” that should be applied? Especially inappropriate words. Don’t let an f-bomb get into a shareholder report.

**Categorical Text (Unique list of values)**

* Store the unique values at the time you are developing, and the counts of each value. Periodically test for new/missing values. Have a plan in place for when this inevitably happens.
* Periodically test for wild changes in distribution. Communicate these to anyone who will listen. This will make you a hero. Provide this list to stakeholders during development. This is always interesting, because often it is vastly different than their estimate.
* If there are multiple categorical fields, is there an hierarchy that is documented and should be followed (if veh\_type is “car”, then veh\_brand can only be “audi”, “ford”, “toyota” etc.). Have a plan in place for when this inevitably breaks.
* Is the field indexed for fast grouping?
* If the values are text numbers (one, two, three) — should they be converted to integers (1, 2, 3)?

**Boolean (True/False)**

* If these represent a “switch” in the process, should the downstream impact also be represented in data? (if override\_price=0 then discount\_price should never be null)
* Store the distribution at the time of developing, and periodically test for changes. Communicate these to anyone who will listen.
* Does True or False have a different name to you customers? IE, 0 = No Sale, 1 = Sale.
* What should you do with nulls, if there are any?

**ID (Keys, AutoNum)**

* Is the ID an AutoNum? If so, are there missing values?
* Is the ID a complex key? Do characters in the complex key relate to the data in any way? Periodically test that this remains true.
* Are duplicates allowed?
* Are you operating under the assumption that the ID for any given record will never change (maintaining an extract or join to a private table)? Have a plan in place for when they inevitably do.
* If you remove the ID from the equation, are there any two completely identical rows?

**General Number/Integer**

* Does null = 0?
* Are negative values expected?
* Are decimals expected? If not, is there rounding occurring upstream? What are the rounding rules?
* Is there a maximum/minimum expected value? Record the minimum and maximum value at the time of development. Periodically test to see if this record has been broken.
* Is there an expected distribution? Periodically test to see if this has changed.
* Is the number secretly categorical (only certain allowed values)?
* Does the number increase in steps instead of linearly (100, 150, 200, 250…)?
* Is the number secretly a phone number or postal code?
* Is there any chance that the number has been cut off to fit in a smaller field (I’m looking at you, Smallint)?
* Is any number field the result of math on other number fields (price\*tax=total)?
* Is there a business preferred format for showing numbers (commas, negative signs)?

**Currency**

* Is there an assumed currency? If not, is there a categorical field that will tell you what currency it is?
* If the record also has a “country” — does the currency match the country?
* Are you converting these currencies to a single currency downstream? If so, store the conversion rates at the time of development.
* Is there a maximum sane currency? Record the maximum and test frequently. Have a plan in place for when it is inevitably broken.
* Does null = 0?
* Does the value represent a “current” value, or a “point in time” value (current price of product, price of product between 2018 and 2019)?
* Are there negative values? Does negative represent a debit or a credit to the company?

**General Contact Information**

* Is there a schedule for updating contact information?
* When was the information last updated?
* When was the information last successfully used?
* If you use this information for any purpose, store the information at the time of use, and the reason for use. If possible, get as many employees as possible to do this in the same location using the same format.
* Do any two customers have the same piece of contact information?
* Does any contact information match your own company/office information?
* Does any customer’s information match that of a current or former employee?
* Is there a no-marketing list that you should be aware of? Ask multiple people and get excited when there are multiple answers!

**Phone Numbers**

* Is there an assumed country code? If not, is the country code stored in another field?
* Do not assume the country of residence is the country code of the phone number.
* Does the phone number follow the rules of that country code?
* Is there an assumed area code?
* Is the area code a toll free area code?
* Is the area code a legitimate area code?
* Is the phone number stored as text?
* Is there any rhyme or reason to the formatting of the phone number? If it is text, is there a single format? What do you do with numbers that do not match that format?
* Is there a preferred format for displaying phone numbers?
* Are you removing “bogus” phone numbers (All the same digits, counting up, etc.).
* If there is a dialer campaign that returns invalid phone numbers, is anything being done with that information?

**Mailing Address**

* Is there an assumed country? If not, is the country stored in another field?
* Is the address free entry text, or cleaned via a service?
* If it is cleaned, what happens to un-cleanable records?
* Is the Postal Code -&gt; State/Region -&gt; Country strictly enforced?
* Is the mailing address in an expected area of business?
* Is there an additional “APT” or “PO BOX” field? Should you be aware of this?
* If there is a latitude/longitude field, does it match the address? Do many customers have the same latitude/longitude?

**Sensitive PII**

* Are these fields humanely appropriate for modeling or analysis (ethnicity, income)?
* Do you need to be aware of HIPAA guidelines?

**Financial Information**

* God help you if your company is storing unmasked financial information.
* Did two different customers make a transaction with the same credit card? Or the same last four digits and expiration date?
* See what your most popular card type is and and provide this to your marketing department if there is a clear winner, for use with reward programs.

**Date / Time**

* Is this a system recorded timestamp field, or human entry?
* Is the time being stored with an assumed time zone?
* Store the minimum date-time during development. Periodically check to see if this has changed.
* Are there any dates with missing information? For example, there are sales every day of February except the 12th.
* Are there records outside business hours?
* Are there any fields that look like they were entered before their timestamp (people trying to create records in the past)?
* Are there any dates that are in the future?
* Do you need to have a specific game plan for leap years?
* Do you need to have a specific game plan for holidays?
* When counting records by day or hour, are there any outliers?Communicate this to stakeholders as soon as possible. Check this frequently — it’s valuable information and will make you famous when you catch something. Additionally, it will ruin your model if there was a rare event.
* If there are multiple date fields, should they have an order of operations (field2 should always be after field1).
* Does everyone know what “biweekly” means?
* Does everyone know what “midnight” means?
* Is there a business preferred date format?
* For forecasting purposes - keep a separate table telling you what dates to NOT take into account when training forecast models. IE - Hurricanes, marketing campaigns, giant international pandemics.
* Do you have a plan for daylight savings time?

&lt;li&gt;Does the number increase in steps instead of linearly (100, 150, 200, 250…)?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is the number secretly a phone number or postal code?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is there any chance that the number has been cut off to fit in a smaller field (I’m looking at you, Smallint)?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is any number field the result of math on other number fields (price*tax=total)?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is there a business preferred format for showing numbers (commas, negative signs)?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Currency&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is there an assumed currency? If not, is there a categorical field that will tell you what currency it is?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If the record also has a “country” — does the currency match the country?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are you converting these currencies to a single currency downstream? If so, store the conversion rates at the time of development.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is there a maximum sane currency? Record the maximum and test frequently. Have a plan in place for when it is inevitably broken.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Does null = 0?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Does the value represent a “current” value, or a “point in time” value (current price of product, price of product between 2018 and 2019)?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are there negative values? Does negative represent a debit or a credit to the company?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;General Contact Information&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is there a schedule for updating contact information?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When was the information last updated?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When was the information last successfully used?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you use this information for any purpose, store the information at the time of use, and the reason for use. If possible, get as many employees as possible to do this in the same location using the same format.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do any two customers have the same piece of contact information?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Does any contact information match your own company/office information?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Does any customer’s information match that of a current or former employee?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is there a no-marketing list that you should be aware of? Ask multiple people and get excited when there are multiple answers!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Phone Numbers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is there an assumed country code? If not, is the country code stored in another field?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do not assume the country of residence is the country code of the phone number.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Does the phone number follow the rules of that country code?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is there an assumed area code?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is the area code a toll free area code?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is the area code a legitimate area code?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is the phone number stored as text?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is there any rhyme or reason to the formatting of the phone number? If it is text, is there a single format? What do you do with numbers that do not match that format?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is there a preferred format for displaying phone numbers?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are you removing “bogus” phone numbers (All the same digits, counting up, etc.).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If there is a dialer campaign that returns invalid phone numbers, is anything being done with that information?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mailing Address&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is there an assumed country? If not, is the country stored in another field?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is the address free entry text, or cleaned via a service?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If it is cleaned, what happens to un-cleanable records?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is the Postal Code -&amp;gt; State/Region -&amp;gt; Country strictly enforced?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is the mailing address in an expected area of business?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is there an additional “APT” or “PO BOX” field? Should you be aware of this?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If there is a latitude/longitude field, does it match the address? Do many customers have the same latitude/longitude?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sensitive PII&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are these fields humanely appropriate for modeling or analysis (ethnicity, income)?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do you need to be aware of HIPAA guidelines?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Financial Information&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;God help you if your company is storing unmasked financial information.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Did two different customers make a transaction with the same credit card? Or the same last four digits and expiration date?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;See what your most popular card type is and and provide this to your marketing department if there is a clear winner, for use with reward programs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Date / Time&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is this a system recorded timestamp field, or human entry?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is the time being stored with an assumed time zone?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Store the minimum date-time during development. Periodically check to see if this has changed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are there any dates with missing information? For example, there are sales every day of February except the 12th.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are there records outside business hours?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are there any fields that look like they were entered before their timestamp (people trying to create records in the past)?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are there any dates that are in the future?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do you need to have a specific game plan for leap years?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do you need to have a specific game plan for holidays?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When counting records by day or hour, are there any outliers?Communicate this to stakeholders as soon as possible. Check this frequently — it’s valuable information and will make you famous when you catch something. Additionally, it will ruin your model if there was a rare event.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If there are multiple date fields, should they have an order of operations (field2 should always be after field1).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Does everyone know what “biweekly” means?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Does everyone know what “midnight” means?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is there a business preferred date format?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For forecasting purposes - keep a separate table telling you what dates to NOT take into account when training forecast models. IE - Hurricanes, marketing campaigns, giant international pandemics.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do you have a plan for daylight savings time?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The end! Thanks for reading through, and contributing more ideas. I will try to keep this list updated.&lt;/p&gt;

r/datascience,"I'm using R to do an analysis of my dataset, and there's a lot of EDA and filtering in my code as I compare results of different segments.

r/datascience,"I'm so sorry if this isn't actually allowed here, as I myself am not a data scientist in any capacity. My job however does deal with data, and I'm curious about it. Tl;dr why do companies want certain data and what do they do with it? 

My company provides retailers with pricing data collected by employees in the field. I am one of those Field Data Collectors. Basically I'm assigned several jobs at different stores throughout the week. Some jobs repeat weekly, or monthly, or quarterly. Some jobs require the collecting of certain items on a list, some requiring scanning every item in a category and collecting those prices. 

An example: every week Bullseye wants to know how Walcarts prices a specific 500 items at 20 different stores in the area. I'm assigned 3 stores, go into each of those stores and find the items, scan them, and input the prices. If that store does not carry the exact item I indicate it. Different DCs are assigned the different locations.

I don't even know what happens in my own company after I upload my job to submit the data i've collected, let alone what the retailer does with the data they're given. 

I'm just curious, why do these major retailers (and even some minor more local/ region specific retailers) contract with our company to get this data? What do they use it for? The company website sells itself as ""Our clients benefit from omni-channel, normalized, and actionable Pricing Intelligence at massive scale to inform on-target pricing strategy and maximize business impact."" What does that even mean? 

Another question I have, who benefits most from this data? Is it only the corporations, or is there any benefit to the consumer as well? 

Also, when Bullseye wants pricing from Walcarts, Walcarts sends us to a Rokger banner, and Rokger finally asks for Bullseye data, does that really end up benefiting anybody? They're all getting data from eachother in a circular manner.

In the last years I read some books, but probably they're biased  (being written by people who did it professionally, at least at some  point)

* *Master Algorithm* by Domingos (good book, but it's sort of popular science on ML and the social aspect part is very weak IMO, because it is full of hype and reads more like a sales pitch than result of some analysis)
* *Weapons of Math Destruction* by O'Neill - it touches some relevant points. I'm not sure about the validity given O'Neill's track record though - she once lamented how no one does research on AI fairness (this was in a newspaper article, it was not long ago, when there were established programs and research groups on that). Also book is very political and might sometimes be annoying if you don't exactly lean left
* *Outnumbered* by David Sumpter - this is by far the best book I've read, it's well balanced, like for example the author mentions different metrics that were used to assume whether algorithms made racist predictions or not. Also he doesn't push any ML hype, and actually finds there is no proof for some results that got huge media coverage.
* *Architects of Intelligence* \- it's a set of interviews with ML people. What is great about it is that you can see that there is no consensus on the future of the field, and that people who actually have impact have divergent opinions on some topics (like for example on regulation)
* *AI Superpowers* by Kai-Fu Lee - a book by author who was involved with many facets of ML - research, business side (as head of Google China) and venture capital. This one is especially interesting since aside from AI it describes digitalization in China. One of maiin theses is that the US leads in research, but implementation side is tilted towards China because of different business culture (author says that in China companies are not so innovative, as everyone copies from one another another, but that makes its environment more competitive since it doesn't have so strong founder effect where first company to come up with an idea dominates its niche).

I received my Bachelors in Statistical Science (combo of math, stats, coding) in  Jun 2019 and I have been working as a full time data scientist since I graduated. My manager said that the company  would pay for any bootcamps I want to attend.

A coworker is taking this bootcamp [https://generalassemb.ly/education/data-science-remote-online](https://generalassemb.ly/education/data-science-remote-online), but it seems somewhat introductory?

I am comfortable working with Python, R, SQL. I think I'm a pretty good coder, but I would like to learn more and get better. I really enjoy coding!  I know enough Javascript and HTML to do my job (interactive dashboards using D3js). I'm familiar with ML and have done projects, but I'm not super comfortable. Also, I learned all the math and stats in college, but I haven't done much data analysis in the real world yet so it would be nice to practice those skills.

I mean I've generated a bunch of common templates that I reuse, but every time I need something different, I have to google it because I have absolutely no idea how to do it. It's just not intuitive to me for some reason. Having two APIs makes things even more confusing, and I just can't remember which method works with which API (e.g. to turn off axis labels).

What I've been trying so far:

- reading stackoverflow answers
- reading references
- practicing

Despite all this I'm still terrible with matplotlib. I'm trying to understand why, what I need to be doing differently...

r/datascience,"Wondering if anyone can help me out in my current situation

&amp;#x200B;

**Tl;dr** the company that just hired me is not ready for data scientists. I’m being asked to do things that are very far from my expertise, but I also have no other job prospects. I also really like the field the app is in, have a ton of time while under quarantine, and the motivation to try and make as much of this work as possible. Any help is appreciated.

\----

I’m a data science bootcamp graduate (I know, I know. I apologize for existing.) and not surprisingly have been struggling to find my entry into the field, but I was getting interviews, particularly in my area/domain of interest. Then the virus hit the US and all my prospects shriveled, except for one. It’s a startup in my domain, an app where users would make decisions regarding a particular “score”.

&amp;#x200B;

Originally, we had discussed integrating with his development team (working with them on an initial model of the aforementioned “score”) - then, as the initial model is productionalized, I would switch to data-driven content creation (data viz, dashboards, articles and presentations for non-tech users) to help in communicating technical aspects the product internally, and marketing the product externally, an area of the field I enjoy. Great.

&amp;#x200B;

Well, we negotiated equity, and I sign-on, and it turns out I’m the first (and only) full-time employee. The development team is all freelance. The company has no data engineers, so the founder has asked me for guidance on setting up historical data from an API on our own servers. The extent of my data engineering knowledge is: I’ve used SQL to connect to preexisting architectures, and I’ve seen people use Spark/Hive/Hadoop. I’m researching Apache Airflow like a madman, but (obviously) in way over my head.

&amp;#x200B;

He also wants me to spearhead the marketing campaign. There is no website. There is no chosen domain. But I’ve had dozens of pages of “marketing book notes” delivered to me, and I’m supposed to turn it into some kind of plan for my own content, then execute said plan. He wants me to be the lead on creating strategic partnerships within the industry. While I love ""making things"" (I'm also a YT/podcast content creator for fun), I’m not a marketer at whatsoever and don't have some big list of in-industry contacts, so... I’m just completely in the dark there.

&amp;#x200B;

I know a ton of people would just peace out and look for another job, but since I've got no other options at the moment: for those who have been in similar situations and stuck it out: who’ve dealt with a founder/boss with unrealistic expectations re: what one entry-level data scientist can do, I’d love to hear how you went about A) your work (what tools/resources) you saught-out and B) how you handled communicating unrealistic expectations while still doing your level-best to rise to the occasion.

* **Ability to check your data and findings against the product output / business situation**: How do you know what you pulled is right? That your findings make sense? Do your numbers hold water against someone who knows the product data and inter-workings inside and out?
* **Non technical stakeholder communication skills**: This includes presentations, building rapport and relationships, managing up, managing different attitudes, understanding perspectives, understanding how to ask questions and listen between the lines, building strong daily partnerships
* **Business strategy skills**: Now that you’ve completed this project, now what? What does this mean for the business? How do you see the whole board and make a recommendation that fits in? 
* **Grit and attitude**: AKA the ability to wrangle through messy problem,  messy data, and with messy relationships and politics. Know how to get through the mess, how to self problem solve, and when to call in favors. Also, have a willingness to do grunt work, like write SQL, or figure out what the product data is, how it is produced, and wtf the engineers were thinking when they structured the product in that way.
* **Politicking and relationship building**: understand how to work with product, biz line owners, execs, etc to solve problems. Have a strong willingness to HELP OTHERS! 
* **Tableau / data viz in some way**: be able to clearly relay your findings, with ""like I'm 5"" attitude, to people who are not comfortable with even basic bar charts or graphs. You should be able to look at a graph at a glance and consume what it is telling you. 

Then... python/R, special packages, math, modeling, etc. 

I see so many people worried about x language or Y package, where I actually think those are relatively easy to learn. The soft skills aren’t taught in school and are VERY important - and the hardest to find! 

Honestly, analysts and data scientists don't get to do the cool stuff all the time. There is a lot of boring stuff that is easy to do, technically.

**EDIT TO ADD:**
* When all else is equal, we hire based on culture and team fit, and willingness to learn. **Attitude and fit often outweigh technical skills!**

* The requisite mastery level certainly does depend on the job level. For more junior level candidates, I understand when you haven’t developed those yet... but how is your attitude? Do you think you know everything bc you have the hard skills down? Or do you recognize that you are just starting out and the soft skills are what you need to learn?

Talk about how you solved the business problem first, then about the tools you used to get there. I like hearing about cool stuff, but I also need to know you can do the basic stuff and the soft skills REALLY well.

r/datascience,"I have a website that organizes factual claims and allows the community to rate them based on objective qualities.  One current feature associated with each claim is called ""topics"".  I'm considering a redesign where topics are calculated automatically based on the contents of the claim, its sources, and its evidence provided.

Technology is no bother for me, as I built the website from the ground up.  However, I know next to nothing about data science.  I've spent most of today researching where I even need to begin.

What I think I'm looking for is called Text Classification.  Here's what I imagine my process would look like.

1. Certain users sometimes enter topics with each claim.  When they do, the back-end will take that opportunity to train a model with the user provided topics.  Maybe I have to spend some time training the model myself, which is fine.  Who trains it doesn't matter, but I would like the model to be trained against a specific set of topics.  This could eventually be in the thousands.
2. Certain users take advantage of auto-tagging of topics, and the claim document is then submitted to the text classification service by the back-end where it will predict one to many topics automatically.
3. Depending on other services provided by the text classification solution, it may also be used for fuzzy searching and trending topics.

Here's where I'm uncertain:

1. Am I on the right track with text classification as the right solution to this problem?  I've seen several tools for ""text annotation"" but those seem more interactive, and tied to recognizing existing named entities, whereas I want to train the model against a more tailored lexicon (train a document against a topic/category/label/whatever).
2. Most examples I saw while researching only used one topic to train one document, and got only one topic in return when predicting a document.  I am looking for a solution where I can provide many topics per doc in training, and get many topics back when predicting.
3. Does training end, or is it continuous?  Is there such a thing as over-training?  I'd also need to factor in storage size for trained topics, especially if it is continuous.
4. Can text classification be used to determine topics that are trending and fading?  Or, is that a different data science approach/solution?
5. I think I found what I need in GCP [AutoML](https://cloud.google.com/automl) Natural Languare Processing API, but it is too expensive ($5 per 1000 doc predictions!?).
6. And, assuming I'm on the right track with all of this, does anyone know of any production-ready service API's or docker images out there, or even libraries I could integrate with or build a service around?  I'm technology agnostic and am comfortable in many languages including python.  But, most everything I've found seems one-off, white-paper-ish, experimental, small-scale (i.e. in-memory only), etc...  Here are the ones that seemed closest to what I want to do:
   1. [natural](https://www.npmjs.com/package/natural) \- node toolsuite with most everything I think I need, but would need to build up persistence storage and run benchmarking to assess its scalability.
   2. [prodi.gy](https://prodi.gy) \- Seems more UI human interaction focused, rather than API driven.  And, not sure about custom lexicon given the emphasis on general annotation.
   3. [tagtog](https://www.tagtog.net/) \- Same comments as [prodi.gy](https://prodi.gy), but  got excited when I saw they had a docker image. Didn't seem like the right solution for my problem, though.
   4. [cortex](https://www.cortex.dev/) \- AWS based, service based, but wasn't clear on how they offer text classification at all.  I wondered if I could makeshift their sentiment analysis just using a custom  topics.  I could work with AWS, but it's not my first choice
   5. [monkeylearn.com](https://monkeylearn.com) and various other services that aren't upfront about pricing or are just too expensive.
   6. [xgboost.readthedocs.io](https://xgboost.readthedocs.io) \- here's one that I believe is production ready and \*probably\*, but I have a hard time figuring out what the heck it does or what I do with it!
   7. [klassify](https://github.com/fatiherikli/klassify) \- This one seemed the most straightforward, and closest to what I'm trying to do, has a docker image, works with redis, and so it seems scalable.  But, I wasn't sure if anyone had any experience with it or if it meets my requirement of pulling multiple topics out of one document (at first glance it only seems to work with one).

Appreciate any help on the matter!  I have a [sandbox](https://sandbox.thinkards.org) up if that helps gauge what the website abilities are.  I'm aware the UI/UX needs some work, and I am working on it (that's at least two things I'm clueless on)!

But, I wasn&amp;#39;t sure if anyone had any experience with it or if it meets my requirement of pulling multiple topics out of one document (at first glance it only seems to work with one).&lt;/li&gt;

r/datascience,"Hello data science subreddit, 

I have a question. I'm thinking about doing a minor in data science and later on maby a master. I'm doing a bachelor in marketing, and right now I'm doing an internship in marketing insights (research). I have really taken an interest in data and statistics and also data science. I would love to learn more about it but there is one thing holding me back.

 I am dyslectic and I have discalculia, both diagnosed at a very young age. There both not as severe now that I'm older. Mainly I'm bad at spelling and mental arithmetics. But I will also  misread numbers or letters or remember them wrong fairly often. So this might lead to small errors here and there.

On my current internship it's not a super big deal because we always look over everyone's work before sending it out anyway. 

But I guess my question is to anyone reading, is it a stupid idea to get into data science with these learning disabilities because I'm probably more prone to making errors? 
If there is anyone working (or studying) in data science who is dyslectic or has discalculia I would love to hear about your experience.
Don't be afraid to give me an honest answer, I want to know.

r/datascience,"Hello, fellow Data Scientists,   


With the current lockdown for COVID, I found myself with a decent amount of free time on my hands that I wish to repurpose for my own growth. 

I'm a junior data scientist, working more on the MLE side of things (but also building models). 

I seek advice regarding the following: 

  
A. I can invest this out-of-work time to develop my current work skills:   

- Python: improve from intermediate+ (design and write better OOP, develop a more software dev style of coding)

r/datascience,"I'm excited (and nervous) to share a product I've been working on for the past few months to get feedback from this community. While I'm more of a *heavy* lurker, /r/datascience has always been an excellent source of discovery and insights for Data Scientists both new and experienced.

I've seen a lot of frustrations when it comes to making Data Science effective in an organization. Issues like:

- Complicated tooling and configurations
- Lack of pipeline and data testing
- Lack of visibility into projects as they start to expand in complexity
- Being forced to wear hats for every step of the end-to-end data cycle
- Different data teams operating in silos
- Lack of access to required cloud resources
- Projects rarely making it to production

All of these issues make it difficult for a Data Science team to drive value and build trust. But I don't think it should have to be that way.

With these frustrations in mind, I set out to build a workflow platform - [Shipyard](https://www.shipyardapp.com) - that helps eliminate the friction of getting solutions to production so Data Scientists can focus more on Data, not DevOps.

To be brief, we've designed the platform to:

- Launch solutions with no DevOps or complicated setups involved. We're cloud-native and handle all scaling on your behalf.
- Orchestrate solutions across teams to create complex pipelines with no edits or additions to your code.
- Monitor and alert on the status of hundreds of solutions for peace of mind.
- Share custom, repeatable solutions with the larger organization using Blueprints.

We're still in the early stages, so I'm looking for anyone that might be interested in testing us out and providing feedback. It's 100% free right now in exchange for your feedback. If you're interested, let me know.

r/datascience,"Since the number of test varies significantly between individual countries, and no country is is even close to reaching 100% test coverage, the reported infections have to be taken with a gigantic grain of salt. However, reported deaths should be much more accurate, since everybody who dies as a consequence of a covid infection pretty much has to be ""in the system"".

So I tried to find a way to ""backtrack"" actual infection numbers based on reported deaths and some other parameters. The calculation could look something like this:

**Assumptions**

* Number of infections is doubling every 3 days
* It takes on average 12 days from infection to death
* Case fatality rate is 2.5%
* There are 100 new deaths reported today

**Calclulation**

* We know, that the people who died today have been infected about 12 days ago. Since 2.5% of infected people die, we can now calculate the number of people who were newly infected 12 days ago with n=100/0.025 = 4000
* We know, that the number of infections doubles every 3 days. Therefore, the number of newly infected people today has to equate, all things being equal, 2^((12 / 3)) = 16 times the amount of 12 days ago. Thus, we can assume that, today 16\*4000=64000 people will be infected
* We can run this calculation for every date, resulting in a timeseries of (new)infections
* We can take the cumulative sum of that timeseries to retrieve the final timeseries of cumulative total estimated infections

&amp;#x200B;

I created a little tool using streamlit to visualize the timeseries and play around with the assumptions for different countries:

The Python source can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/ZanyCode/covid-sim). You can also [play around with it directly](https://covid-sim.sloppy.zone/).

r/datascience,"One of the ostensible selling points of Python over R is that Python supposedly deals better with large data sets, as it doesn't store datasets in memory. However, I recently learned from this very subreddit that pandas stores datasets in memory.

r/datascience,"Hey all,

So brief summary, I applied for a Market Analyst position (first analyst position in general) and essentially after proving my SQL skills in a few, very tedious interviews beforehand, made it to the final interview (via video, woo!)

It was this last question in this final interview that just threw me off of everything, as I have like no statistical experience/knowledge (except for taking one stats class in early college lol). 

So I know this is probably simpler than I made it out to be in my head, but it being in the moment, and again, my lack of statistical knowledge in general, I literally was stumped. 


Essentially here’s what I was given:

Upon past email marketing survey efforts to a test send group of 10,000 customers, we had a 20% response rate. We then had a control group to 1,000 customers, and had a response rate of 15% with them. 

We want to lower the control group and yet, be confident we can measure the response rate with statistical significance. What would you recommend?


So basically, I pulled stuff out my ass with things like “further personalization of the designs of these email surveys as we decrease the control group size, as well as trigger(automate) emails to send surveys out in a more timely manner” (LOL) etc etc; knowing damn well that this problem isn’t really focused on the process or design of the survey itself.

They tried giving me a hint saying that this is supposed to be conceptual and there’s no one right answer and they don’t need exact calculations or anything but more of the statistical thought process one would go through for this experiment.


The only stats I remember was like simple t-tests (one sample and independent samples) but I’m rusty in both concepts and definitely need to go back and refresh every little thing about them. Plus, wasn’t even sure if this scenario even constitutes those two tests lol. 

I was feeling so good up until then since literally all of the other interviews and questions were about SQL and they were really impressed by my queries and such. And on top of that, they said most of the day to day is SQL so I felt like this might be my first analyst position I could finally land.

But what’s done is done and as I wait for a decision, I wanted to see what thought process you guys would’ve essentially said (in simplest terms?) so that I can learn and just be able to familiarize myself with some of these terminologies for future references.

Thanks in advance for any input on the matter~

EDIT: should’ve added their response when I asked for general clarification:


“So let’s say whatever lower control group we chose, we saw that the new response rate was 10%. How do we know that that given response rate can be trusted and significant? “

“Again, don’t focus on the actual value of the new response rate. It could be 15% or 20%. We just wanted to know how you’d go about saying that this response rate was not just an anomoly but can be trusted in the sense that in the future if we wanted to use the same control group number then we can expect that same response rate?”",t2_43rjm8zb,What’s the simplest way I should’ve answered this conceptual statistics/methodology question in my interview (Market Analyst)?,discussion,t3_fqzhwd,0.75,2,Discussion,2,1585483501.0,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey all,&lt;/p&gt;

r/datascience,"*TL;DR: fill this 4 min survey to save the planet :)* [https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/QFQJH7V](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/QFQJH7V)  
   
As you all know, governments across the planet are struggling to contain the spread of Covid-19. The reason behind this is simple: things are moving too quickly making it extremely difficult to keep track of what is happening and where it is happening. The answer is simple: **DATA**!

Until treatments and vaccines are developed, data is our greatest weapon against Covid-19, and it’s about time we used it. We are launching a global survey to collect and analyze data from citizens across the planet - the first of its kind in history- to help governments and our communities in their battle against the greatest challenge of the Internet Age.

All we are asking for is four minutes of your time to share this post and fill out this simple, completely anonymous survey that can save thousands, if not millions of lives, as well as the livelihoods of most small business owners and day laborers. If you answer these questions as accurately as possible, you will provide us with extremely valuable information that can reveal where outbreak zones are and how they have been developing over the past few weeks. That means seeing an early end to the mass quarantine measures currently being employed and enforced around the planet.

**How?** Well, for example, if thirty people on your block report that they have symptoms consistent with Covid-19, your local government will be able to act quickly to treat patients, contain the local spread, and warn those on your block to take extra steps to safeguard themselves. You yourself will be more cautious and will have a direct view of your neighborhood's status regarding the coronavirus.

Imagine the network effect, and application of wisdom of the crowd to actually get more insight and provide a new angle to specialist &amp; data analysts to come-up with the most impactful solutions.

All of this anonymous information will be released daily on Kaggle and Github so that researchers, data scientists, companies and governments can quickly access and analyze it.

Thank you for your patience, your input and your time, here is a link to the survey: [https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/QFQJH7V](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/QFQJH7V)

r/datascience,"Data Scientist here in a mid-sized company in Bay Area tech. After working in this industry for few years, the fact that Data Scientist in no longer a true Data Scientist position is the only natural conclusion I can come up with. There are obviously those in companies, reputable or not, who get to do and productionize complex modeling solutions (especially if you have a PhD), but the overall trend is that most ""Data Scientists"" without PhDs in big companies have become SQL monkeys who don't even get to do something as simple as A/B testing. This is like if front-end web developers were rebranded as software engineers.

I mean it's even public knowledge too:  Lyft publicly stated how they rebranded the titles from analyst to scientist and data scientist to research scientist. This was  just to compete with other tech companies for talent that want the ""scientist"" in their title. [https://medium.com/@chamandy/whats-in-a-name-ce42f419d16c](https://medium.com/@chamandy/whats-in-a-name-ce42f419d16c). I was told by a buddy in FANG that Facebook is the one that started this trend.

How did this happen and what's the consequence? I don't know the precise origin, but I know that today what's driving this movement is the huge rush new grads with ""data science"" degrees, or perhaps waves of career changers from bootcamps who also want to find their gold.

What's the consequence? I think the consequence is that we all suffer from the rebranding, especially in terms of career development. First of all, it cheapens the name for everyone who holds this title. Second, those who have been doing true Data Science work (not just SQL all day for metrics tracking) will have to shift expectations and titles in order to preserve what they already have. Third, being stuck on menial tasks that don't impact business bottom line will make the job more expendable, meaningly highly susceptible to layoffs far more than those that are in the front lines of business/product impact. Fourth, this means lack of promotion and career development, since those who do get those have proven impact on business.

Yes, I have become jaded and pessimistic about the Data Science world in the Bay, especially not having a PhD myself that limits me from pursuing Research Scientists positions...

**EDIT:** It's quite funny that half of agree with me and half of you disagree vehemently. I actually want to be proven wrong in this case. But I'm nonetheless surprised that people couldn't care less about the HR who are cheapening the name of a scientist to make their job search easier and directing all their criticism toward a fellow Data Scientist just for pointing this situation out.

Also, yes, titles might not matter for you individually, but not having a clear breakdown of the work expectations in an organizational and institutional level is not a sign of progress. You wouldn't make this claim on the murky division is labor on government or hospital jobs for instance, or any positions of authority in public/private space.

Finally, Science as a title infers hypothesis, testing, validation through formulaic rules (mathematic or otherwise), etc. Yea sure at the end of the day, titles are just semantics, but the other extreme end of that is saying that ""well what's the problem of giving a someone who munges chemistry data the title of a ""Chemical Scientist""? Hell let's call anyone who deals with legal data a Lawyer. What this shows it that titles do matter to some degree, because it infers authority over a particular subject and the technical know-how.

r/datascience,"StellarGraph is an open-source library featuring state-of-the-art graph machine learning algorithms. The project is delivered as part of CSIRO's Data61.

Five algorithms and streamlined onboarding are only some of the major new features delivered in the [0.11 release](https://github.com/stellargraph/stellargraph/releases/tag/v0.11.0) of the library, with substantial API, documentation and demo improvements to support users in running and exploring StellarGraph functionality.

New algorithms include:

* Watch Your Step: computes node embeddings by simulating the effect of random walks, rather than doing them.
* Deep Graph Infomax: performs unsupervised node representation learning.
* Temporal Random Walks (Continuous-Time Dynamic Network Embeddings): random walks that respect the time that each edge occurred.
* ComplEx: computes multiplicative complex-number embeddings for entities and relationships (edge types) in knowledge graphs, used for link prediction.
* DistMult: computes multiplicative real-number embeddings for entities and relationships (edge types) in knowledge graphs, used for link prediction.[ ](https://github.com/stellargraph/stellargraph/issues/755)

A sixth algorithm remains under active development, but is available in this release as an experimental preview:

* GCNSupervisedGraphClassification: supervised graph classification model based on Graph Convolutional layers (GCN).

The new release incorporates extensive enhancements and bug fixes, some of which include: 

* StellarGraph.to\_adjacency\_matrix is at least 15 times faster on undirected graphs[ ](https://github.com/stellargraph/stellargraph/pull/932)
* ClusterNodeGenerator is noticeably faster, reducing the time taken to train and predict with a ClusterGCN model 
* Addition of a subgraph method for computing a node-induced subgraph
* Addition of a connected\_components method for computing the nodes involved in each connected component in a StellarGraph
* The info method has been improved for heterogeneous graphs with many types and also shows information about the size and type of each node type's feature vectors
* Four new datasets added to stellargraph.datasets
* Neo4j functionality is now tested on CI
* Example Jupyter notebooks can now be run directly in Google Colab and Binder
* New notebooks demonstrating how to construct a StellarGraph object from Pandas, and from NetworkX.

The problem is that we sync our code up with git, but the data is stored
locally. So that if someone else wants to run the code or something there's
an issue.

The data comes from a mixture of sources

* most is from Google Storage
* some is from data scraping / whatever during the project
* some is processed data

I was thinking about having a local directory rsynced up to the data storage,
and sync on git pushes with a git hook.

An issue with this is that there would be duplication of data, for example,
if I have some `data.csv`, then it might originally be located at

```
storage/bucket_1/data.csv
```
I pull this down to my local project
```
project/data/thing/raw/data.csv
```
and then I sync my local data up to storage again, putting it at
```
storage/bucket_2/data/thing/raw/data.csv
```
So that data now exists in two places, which isn't so great.

I'm not aware of a process to prevent this though and would appreciate any
thoughts/considerations that others have.

I hope that everything is ok and that you are handling the quarantine well. I am currently a student in Milano doing my P.h.D. in Psychology. Furthermore, I am a Rossoneri in my heart for almost 20 years now (you can imagine that I am living the dream because I am living in Milano right now).

If you are bored and need something to fill your time I got the perfect solution for you. Could you fill out a questionnaire for a study I am doing? My data collection is not going well and I really need some participants. Furthermore, some of the items are pretty interesting and could help you dealing with the quarantine boredom (if it is present). So it's basically a win/win. My study is about the relationship between future self-continuity (do we feel connected to our future self or not) and moral decision making. In other words, I want to see whether the degree of our perceived connectedness to ourselves in the future is related to decisions we make about moral dilemmas.

**The questionnaire is for Italian speakers only.** This is an exploratory study and it would require approximately 40 minutes of your time. If you are interested you can check out the link below:

&amp;#x200B;

Can anyone see what I'm missing or suggest somewhere better to post this? I know it's going to be something obvious and I'm going to feel a bit silly but I've been playing with this on and off since the UK entered its lockdown and haven't made any progress.

Mathematical Foundations

These courses are intended to help lay the foundation for learning more advanced maths, as well as foster the development of mathematical thinking. Descriptions come directly from the respective course websites.

Introduction to Logic, Stanford (course)
This course is an introduction to Logic from a computational perspective. It shows how to encode information in the form of logical sentences; it shows how to reason with information in this form; and it provides an overview of logic technology and its applications - in mathematics, science, engineering, business, law, and so forth.

Introduction to Mathematical Thinking, Stanford (course)
Professional mathematicians think a certain way to solve real problems, problems that can arise from the everyday world, or from science, or from within mathematics itself. The key to success in school math is to learn to think inside-the-box. In contrast, a key feature of mathematical thinking is thinking outside-the-box – a valuable ability in today’s world. This course helps to develop that crucial way of thinking.

High School Mathematics, MIT (collection of courses)
In this section we have provided a collection of mathematics courses and resources from across MIT. Some are materials that were used to teach MIT undergraduates, while others were designed specifically for high school students.

 
Algebra

These algebra courses run the gamut from introductory algebra to linear models and matrix algebra. Algebra is helpful in computation and data science generally, and encompasses some of the main concepts in powering some machine learning algorithms, including neural networks. Descriptions come directly from the respective course websites.

Linear Algebra - Foundations to Frontiers, University of Texas at Austin (course)
Through short videos, exercises, visualizations, and programming assignments, you will study Vector and Matrix Operations, Linear Transformations, Solving Systems of Equations, Vector Spaces, Linear Least-Squares, and Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors. In addition, you will get a glimpse of cutting edge research on the development of linear algebra libraries, which are used throughout computational science.

Introduction to Linear Models and Matrix Algebra, Harvard (course)
In this introductory online course in data analysis, we will use matrix algebra to represent the linear models that commonly used to model differences between experimental units. We perform statistical inference on these differences. Throughout the course we will use the R programming language to perform matrix operations.

 
Calculus

These calculus courses cover topics from preparatory precalculus through to differentiation, integration, to multivariate calculus and differential equations. Calculus has broad uses, generally, and contains core concepts which power neural networks work. Descriptions come directly from the respective course websites.

Introduction to Calculus, University of Sydney (course)
The focus and themes of the Introduction to Calculus course address the most important foundations for applications of mathematics in science, engineering and commerce. The course emphasises the key ideas and historical motivation for calculus, while at the same time striking a balance between theory and application, leading to a mastery of key threshold concepts in foundational mathematics.

 
Statistics &amp; Probability

Statistics and probability are the foundations of data science, more so than any other family of mathematical concepts. These courses will help prepare you to look at data through the statistical lens and with a critical probabilistic eye. Descriptions come directly from the respective course websites.

Statistics and probability, Khan Academy (course)
Course covers analyzing categorical data, displaying and comparing quantitative data, summarizing quantitative data, modeling data distributions, exploring bivariate numerical data, study design, probability, counting, permutations, and combinations, random variables, sampling distributions, confidence intervals, significance tests, two-sample inference for the difference between groups, inference for categorical data, advanced regression, analysis of variance

Fundamentals of Statistics, MIT (course)
Statistics is the science of turning data into insights and ultimately decisions. Behind recent advances in machine learning, data science and artificial intelligence are fundamental statistical principles. The purpose of this class is to develop and understand these core ideas on firm mathematical grounds starting from the construction of estimators and tests, as well as an analysis of their asymptotic performance

Data Science: Probability, Harvard (course)
We will introduce important concepts such as random variables, independence, Monte Carlo simulations, expected values, standard errors, and the Central Limit Theorem. These statistical concepts are fundamental to conducting statistical tests on data and understanding whether the data you are analyzing is likely occurring due to an experimental method or to chance.

Probability - The Science of Uncertainty and Data, MIT (course)
The course covers all of the basic probability concepts, including: multiple discrete or continuous random variables, expectations, and conditional distributions, laws of large numbers, the main tools of Bayesian inference methods, an introduction to random processes (Poisson processes and Markov chains)

Improving your statistical inferences, Eindhoven University of Technology (course)
First, we will discuss how to correctly interpret p-values, effect sizes, confidence intervals, Bayes Factors, and likelihood ratios, and how these statistics answer different questions you might be interested in. Then, you will learn how to design experiments where the false positive rate is controlled, and how to decide upon the sample size for your study, for example in order to achieve high statistical power. Subsequently, you will learn how to interpret evidence in the scientific literature given widespread publication bias, for example by learning about p-curve analysis. Finally, we will talk about how to do philosophy of science, theory construction, and cumulative science, including how to perform replication studies, why and how to pre-register your experiment, and how to share your results following Open Science principles.

Introduction to Probability and Data, Duke University (course)
This course introduces you to sampling and exploring data, as well as basic probability theory and Bayes' rule. You will examine various types of sampling methods, and discuss how such methods can impact the scope of inference. A variety of exploratory data analysis techniques will be covered, including numeric summary statistics and basic data visualization. You will be guided through installing and using R and RStudio (free statistical software), and will use this software for lab exercises and a final project. The concepts and techniques in this course will serve as building blocks for the inference and modeling courses in the Specialization.

Probability Theory and Mathematical Statistics, Penn State (course)
Courseware for a pair of related courses covers introduction to probability, discrete distributions, continuous distributions, bivariate distributions, ditributions of functions of random variables, estimation, hypothesis testing, nonparametric methods, bayesian methods, and more.

 
Mathematics for Data Science &amp; Machine Learning

These are mathematics topics directly related to data science and machine learning. They may include material from courses above, and may also be more elementary than some of above as well. However, they can be useful for brushing up on material you may not have studied in a while, and which is especially pertinent to the practice of data science. Descriptions come directly from the respective course websites.

Data Science Math Skills, Duke University (course)
Data science courses contain math—no avoiding that! This course is designed to teach learners the basic math you will need in order to be successful in almost any data science math course and was created for learners who have basic math skills but may not have taken algebra or pre-calculus. Data Science Math Skills introduces the core math that data science is built upon, with no extra complexity, introducing unfamiliar ideas and math symbols one-at-a-time.

Essential Math for Machine Learning: Python Edition, Microsoft (course)
This course is not a full math curriculum; it's not designed to replace school or college math education. Instead, it focuses on the key mathematical concepts that you'll encounter in studies of machine learning. It is designed to fill the gaps for students who missed these key concepts as part of their formal education, or who need to refresh their memories after a long break from studying math.

Mathematics for Machine Learning, Imperial College London (specialization)
For a lot of higher level courses in Machine Learning and Data Science, you find you need to freshen up on the basics in mathematics - stuff you may have studied before in school or university, but which was taught in another context, or not very intuitively, such that you struggle to relate it to how it’s used in Computer Science. This specialization aims to bridge that gap, getting you up to speed in the underlying mathematics, building an intuitive understanding, and relating it to Machine Learning and Data Science.",t2_5e236x3p,Free Mathematics Courses for Data Science &amp; Machine Learning,education,t3_fn9414,0.97,483,Education,483,1584946712.0,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s no secret that mathematics is the foundation of data science.

&lt;p&gt;Linear Algebra, MIT (course)
This is a basic subject on matrix theory and linear algebra. Emphasis is given to topics that will be useful in other disciplines, including systems of equations, vector spaces, determinants, eigenvalues, similarity, and positive definite matrices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Linear Algebra - Foundations to Frontiers, University of Texas at Austin (course)
Through short videos, exercises, visualizations, and programming assignments, you will study Vector and Matrix Operations, Linear Transformations, Solving Systems of Equations, Vector Spaces, Linear Least-Squares, and Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors. In addition, you will get a glimpse of cutting edge research on the development of linear algebra libraries, which are used throughout computational science.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Introduction to Linear Models and Matrix Algebra, Harvard (course)
In this introductory online course in data analysis, we will use matrix algebra to represent the linear models that commonly used to model differences between experimental units. We perform statistical inference on these differences. Throughout the course we will use the R programming language to perform matrix operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; 
Calculus&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These calculus courses cover topics from preparatory precalculus through to differentiation, integration, to multivariate calculus and differential equations. Calculus has broad uses, generally, and contains core concepts which power neural networks work. Descriptions come directly from the respective course websites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Precalculus, Khan Academy (course)
Course covers complex numbers, polynomials, composite functions, trigonometry, vectors, matrices, series, conic sections, probability and combinatorics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Calculus 1, Khan Academy (course)
Course covers limits and continuity, derivatives: definitions and basic rules, derivatives: chain rule and other advanced topics, applications of derivatives, analyzing functions, integrals, differential equations, applications of integrals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Calculus 2, Khan Academy (course)
Course covers integrals review, integration techniques, differential equations, applications of integrals, parametric equations, polar coordinates, and vector-valued functions, series.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Multivariable calculus, Khan Academy (course)

&lt;p&gt;Differential equations, Khan Academy (course)
Course covers first order differential equations, second order differential equations, Laplace transform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Introduction to Calculus, University of Sydney (course)
The focus and themes of the Introduction to Calculus course address the most important foundations for applications of mathematics in science, engineering and commerce. The course emphasises the key ideas and historical motivation for calculus, while at the same time striking a balance between theory and application, leading to a mastery of key threshold concepts in foundational mathematics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; 
Statistics &amp;amp; Probability&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Statistics and probability are the foundations of data science, more so than any other family of mathematical concepts. These courses will help prepare you to look at data through the statistical lens and with a critical probabilistic eye. Descriptions come directly from the respective course websites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Statistics and probability, Khan Academy (course)
Course covers analyzing categorical data, displaying and comparing quantitative data, summarizing quantitative data, modeling data distributions, exploring bivariate numerical data, study design, probability, counting, permutations, and combinations, random variables, sampling distributions, confidence intervals, significance tests, two-sample inference for the difference between groups, inference for categorical data, advanced regression, analysis of variance&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fundamentals of Statistics, MIT (course)
Statistics is the science of turning data into insights and ultimately decisions. Behind recent advances in machine learning, data science and artificial intelligence are fundamental statistical principles. The purpose of this class is to develop and understand these core ideas on firm mathematical grounds starting from the construction of estimators and tests, as well as an analysis of their asymptotic performance&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Data Science: Probability, Harvard (course)
We will introduce important concepts such as random variables, independence, Monte Carlo simulations, expected values, standard errors, and the Central Limit Theorem. These statistical concepts are fundamental to conducting statistical tests on data and understanding whether the data you are analyzing is likely occurring due to an experimental method or to chance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Probability - The Science of Uncertainty and Data, MIT (course)
The course covers all of the basic probability concepts, including: multiple discrete or continuous random variables, expectations, and conditional distributions, laws of large numbers, the main tools of Bayesian inference methods, an introduction to random processes (Poisson processes and Markov chains)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Improving your statistical inferences, Eindhoven University of Technology (course)
First, we will discuss how to correctly interpret p-values, effect sizes, confidence intervals, Bayes Factors, and likelihood ratios, and how these statistics answer different questions you might be interested in. Then, you will learn how to design experiments where the false positive rate is controlled, and how to decide upon the sample size for your study, for example in order to achieve high statistical power. Subsequently, you will learn how to interpret evidence in the scientific literature given widespread publication bias, for example by learning about p-curve analysis. Finally, we will talk about how to do philosophy of science, theory construction, and cumulative science, including how to perform replication studies, why and how to pre-register your experiment, and how to share your results following Open Science principles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Introduction to Probability and Data, Duke University (course)
This course introduces you to sampling and exploring data, as well as basic probability theory and Bayes&amp;#39; rule. You will examine various types of sampling methods, and discuss how such methods can impact the scope of inference. A variety of exploratory data analysis techniques will be covered, including numeric summary statistics and basic data visualization. You will be guided through installing and using R and RStudio (free statistical software), and will use this software for lab exercises and a final project. The concepts and techniques in this course will serve as building blocks for the inference and modeling courses in the Specialization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Probability Theory and Mathematical Statistics, Penn State (course)
Courseware for a pair of related courses covers introduction to probability, discrete distributions, continuous distributions, bivariate distributions, ditributions of functions of random variables, estimation, hypothesis testing, nonparametric methods, bayesian methods, and more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; 
Mathematics for Data Science &amp;amp; Machine Learning&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are mathematics topics directly related to data science and machine learning. They may include material from courses above, and may also be more elementary than some of above as well. However, they can be useful for brushing up on material you may not have studied in a while, and which is especially pertinent to the practice of data science. Descriptions come directly from the respective course websites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Data Science Math Skills, Duke University (course)
Data science courses contain math—no avoiding that! This course is designed to teach learners the basic math you will need in order to be successful in almost any data science math course and was created for learners who have basic math skills but may not have taken algebra or pre-calculus. Data Science Math Skills introduces the core math that data science is built upon, with no extra complexity, introducing unfamiliar ideas and math symbols one-at-a-time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Essential Math for Machine Learning: Python Edition, Microsoft (course)
This course is not a full math curriculum; it&amp;#39;s not designed to replace school or college math education. Instead, it focuses on the key mathematical concepts that you&amp;#39;ll encounter in studies of machine learning. It is designed to fill the gaps for students who missed these key concepts as part of their formal education, or who need to refresh their memories after a long break from studying math.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mathematics for Machine Learning, Imperial College London (specialization)
For a lot of higher level courses in Machine Learning and Data Science, you find you need to freshen up on the basics in mathematics - stuff you may have studied before in school or university, but which was taught in another context, or not very intuitively, such that you struggle to relate it to how it’s used in Computer Science. This specialization aims to bridge that gap, getting you up to speed in the underlying mathematics, building an intuitive understanding, and relating it to Machine Learning and Data Science.&lt;/p&gt;

I really want out, and get a data science position in the next 3 month, preferably out in the West Coast but I'll take anything that's decent. I'm seriously considering quitting. I got $100k saved so I should survive for awhile. Just wonder how bad it's gonna look to future employers, and also I don't know the time frame to get a data science job in this recession... Has this virus impacted your job search so far?

Advice?

I'm Shay (written erroneously; pronounced Shy), a data science consultant out of Israel.

I've been dedicating a lot of thought to peer review in small data science teams (like the ones I use to run, and now consult to). Sure, some of it entails reviewing code, but a lot of our work products and processes are different, and require, I believe, a dedicated peer review process.

I'd love to hear your thoughts on the topic. Is peer review a regular part of the work process in your team? Have you reviewed or been reviewed by a peer? What is your approach? What do you feel is still missing? Have you encountered any structured approaches to this process that are unique to DS/ML teams - especially small ones, where 1 project = 1 data scientist?

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#39;re interested in my approach so far - which we have started implementing at one of my clients&amp;#39;, and I&amp;#39;ve actually reviewed a DS project using this procedure - you are more than welcome to take a look at this blog post, and shout at me for all of my mistakes (friends link, so no paywall): 😗&lt;br/&gt;

r/datascience,"Hey Everyone,

So after a decade of work as an economic analyst, business analyst and data scientist in Iran, I have come to realize that the local economy has zero interest in transforming into a more data-driven state. Data resources are scarce and something as crucial as EDA is frowned upon out of fear that it may expose financial corruption, contradict government-provided statistics, etc. The most exciting thing that could happen in a data scientist’s life here is creating recommender systems for e-commerce platforms, the ones that have not gone under as results of sanctions anyway.

Situation is so severe that the job search term “Data Scientist” which returns tons of opportunities for other nations, offers next to nothing in Iran (Try this with LinkedIn yourselves for an impression of what I am talking about.)

I’m 32, B.Sc. in Industrial Mathematics, M.Sc. in Industrial Engineering, (specializing in Technology Foresight and Sustainable Development) both from top technology schools in Iran. I do have a fairly solid track record in quantitative business analysis/development.

This great community has always helped me make informed decisions. I would welcome any advice as to which countries offer better prospects for an aspiring data person. I do realize that I may have to start by interning at a new company overseas and I am humble enough to do just that.

I'm gonna ask broad questions to try to gather as much feedback as I can and then decide what to do. Everything is a possibility at this stage, there are no right or wrong. I have some data background but it's not relevant and that's why I'm a bit stuck with my thoughts.

**Objective:** Create kind of an Hackaton/program with a company where at the end of the day Data is transformed into relevant business insights. Those insights will be capitalized to generate possible new business models.

**Some questions about:**

**People:** 

\- Should we have several teams working with data? how many people per team, 1 or more? how can they work together - can we assign several roles like: 1 to cross data, 1 to clean the data, etc (is this stupid? lol) ?

\- Are these people data scientists only? Should we have 1 business guy per team to give a different perspective?

\- Should we have Data Scientists in the morning and then business people during the evening?

**Data:** 

\- Should we start with raw data?

\- All the teams should start with the same Data?

\- Should we try to cross data from company with some public government data or other sources?

**Program:** 

\- A morning, 12h, 24h, 2 days? How much time do we need?

\- Should we specify some avenues to explore or let them search for everything?

\- What are the things I have to take into account?

I'm wondering if anyone knows of areas where a data scientist could help, pro-bono, with Covid-19 response in any way?  I've seen the Kaggle comp and some colleagues and I are probably going to try and get involved but was wondering if there are other areas to help.  Been reading about folks trying to work around ventilator/maks/etc. shortages with new designs/production methods, and things like that.  I figure there must be something data science-oriented folks can do (code review even?).

Cheers

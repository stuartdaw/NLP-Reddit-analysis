r/analytics,"Hi guys

I've Googled this pretty hard and can't find an answer, so I think this is the most appropriate subreddit to ask!

I have a few sites set up in Google Analytics, as I'm sure most people do, I need to compare a couple of sites side by side sometimes.

Toggling through the sites on the mobile app is nothing short of frustrating, and opening two or more browsers sessions and resizing them side by side is a bit annoying too.

So, I was wondering, is there a tool/app or something that would allow me to open 2-4 site's analytics in the same browser window or something?

I don't want to compare them by overlapping data in the same graph, rather seeing them in separate windows.

Hope that makes sense.

I’m looking into transitioning to the US from Sweden in the upcoming years. Haven’t decided on the state yet but somewhere near a HCOL area with decent job opportunities.

I’m currently working as a CRM Analyst at a small boutique consultancy firm. Since it’s within consultancy I get to try out a lot of different roles and projects. I’ve worked mostly within FMCG/Retail and e-commerce with some added experience within finance. I majored in Statistics and minored in economics and political science. However, I never finished my bachelor thesis because I managed to land a job before and Working full-time just took up all my time. Really underestimated the workload in consultancy.

My technical competences is mainly SQL and Excel. Can model in Python or R and have worked with SAS Enterprise when I worked in Finance, but wouldn’t say I’m anywhere near proficient enough to do it without guidande.

Besides that I’m also the lead analyst within an account at the firm so a lot of my time goes to planning, stakeholder management , presentations (reports, sales meetings etc) and onboarding Jr colleagues and developing my stream.

I’m not looking into any specific industry och specific analytics position but would like to know any tips on what I should consider when applying for Jobs.

Since I don’t have my bachelor degree I’m guessing that’s going to be a problem. I’m hoping my work experience will outweigh my lack in education.

How difficult is it to find a decent job with work experience instead of a degree? (I did study more than a bachelor but just didn’t turn in a complete version of my thesis)

r/analytics,"Forecasting the dynamics of revenue, audience, and other key metrics is an important process for any product that is in its growth phase. Having a good forecast helps to prioritize projects at the planning stage, and then helps to keep track of how quickly you are growing against the forecast, allowing you to spot problems as early as possible.

The very process of creating a forecasting model allows you to synchronize the team in terms of understanding the product’s growth model. It also provides a tool for assessing the impact of working on different areas of the model.

Today we will talk about building audience and revenue forecasts for your product using cohort analysis. We will also find out the pitfalls and difficulties of this process.

## Cohort analysis is the basis for forecasting audience, revenue, and other business metrics for your app

Cohort analysis is the basis for predicting the dynamics of the key metrics of your business.

This metric divides users into cohorts based on the month they started using the product.

This means that if you build the forecast of a certain metric for a specific cohort of users (those who started using the product in month X) then you can easily project the forecast to the entire product. Thus, the forecast of the entire product can be simplified by scaling it down to a single cohort, which is easier to study. Since the process will be identical among cohorts, the results can then be scaled up to the entire product.  
Forecasting the dynamics of the key metrics for a cohort of users is relatively easy because you can obtain it by analyzing historical data on older cohorts.

Now that we’ve discussed the basic idea behind building metric forecasts for a product, we can get into the different aspects of the process:

* Understanding the relation between the metrics (audience numbers, retention, revenue, etc.) of individual cohorts and the entire product
* Predicting the dynamics of revenue, audience and other metrics for a specific cohort of users
* Predicting the size of the cohorts that will come to the product in the future
* Using Google Sheet templates to predict revenue, audience numbers, and other metrics
* Understanding the nuances, pitfalls and difficulties within the process of building the forecast.

## Understanding the relation between the metrics (audience numbers, retention, revenue, etc.) of individual cohorts and the entire product

Consider the following product, let’s call it X.

### First month after launch

You launch product X in January 2019. In January (the first month after the launch), 1,000 new users come to the product, and they spend $100.

In January, the app’s MAU will be 1,000 users, and the revenue will be $100, since at the moment, the product is entirely represented by one cohort of users who came in January.

### Second month after launch

In February 2019, another thousand new users join the product. They spend another $100. At the same time, 700 of the users who came in January are retained in February. These users spend $70.

Thus, in February (the second month after the launch), the product’s MAU will be composed of the February cohort of active users (1,000 people) and what remains of the January cohort (700 retained users). That is, the audience will equal 1,000 + 700 = 1,700 users.

Revenue in the second month will be equal to $100 + $70 = $170. It will also encompass the revenue of the two currently available cohorts of users.

### Third month after launch

As in previous months, in March, we will add a third cohort of users (people who started using the product in March).The overall metrics will be the sum of metrics for the January, February and March cohorts at the end of March.

### Month-N after launch

When we reach the end of month N after the launch, we will have N cohorts of users based on the month the users started using the product. The MAU for the entire product for month N will be equal to the sum of the audiences of each of the available cohorts in month N.

### Why did we present the audience and revenue for each month as the sum of these metrics for individual cohorts?

The goal of this exercise was to show that the key metrics of your product in any month are directly determined by their corresponding values ​​in the cohorts of users, created based on the date the users joined the product.

This means that if we can predict the metric for all cohorts of users for a specific month, then we can easily get a forecast of this metric for the entire product (by summing the values ​​from all cohorts).

## Predicting the dynamics of revenue, audience numbers and other metrics for a specific cohort of users

Predicting the dynamics of revenue, audience, or any other metric for a particular cohort of users is relatively simple. To do this, you need to use the cohort’s historical data.

Usually, you need to take the oldest relevant product cohorts in order to get their actual dynamics, and then project this dynamics to the new cohorts.

For example, to predict a monthly active audience (MAU), you can take the following steps:

1. Take an old relevant cohort of users and calculate the MAU for this cohort by month. By “relevant” I mean that the cohort must reflect the current state of the product. In this context, a cohort that has existed before a major change to the product does not qualify as relevant.
2. Divide the resulting set of values ​​by the size of the cohort (the number of users in the cohort). At this step you will obtain the monthly retention rate.
3. Using monthly retention, you can easily predict what will be the audience of a particular cohort of users for any month. To do this, multiply the size of the cohort by the retention rate of the corresponding month.
4. If you need to get the dynamics of the predicted metric for months that go beyond what you can get on the basis of the oldest relevant cohorts, you will need to make an assumption about the metric’s future dynamics:

* For example, if the cohort’s audience has been steadily decreasing by 3% every month starting from some point in time, then you can assume that the same trend will continue in the upcoming months.
* If the metric seems stable, you can assume that it won’t change in the coming months.
* There is no universal approach to this task. You will need to decide on a case-by-case basis.

Let’s look at how this will work in the example of the app X that we examined earlier in this essay.

1. We take those who came in January 2019 as an old relevant cohort of users.

2. Based on this cohort, we calculate the monthly retention rate of our product. To do this, we need to divide the audience number by the size of the cohort (1,000 users).

3. Now we can make the MAU forecast of other cohorts for the month we are interested in. For example, the Month 4 MAU of the cohort that came in May 2019 will be equal to the number of users in this cohort multiplied by 4th month retention (1,000 \* 70% = 700).

4. If we want to predict what the cohort’s MAU will be on Month 7, then we will need to assume what will happen with the monthly retention rate.

In our case, the task is simple: retention has remained steady since Month 1, so we can assume that it will remain the same in the following months. As we collect more data in the future, we can modify the forecast if we observe any changes to the retention rate.

The same procedure will help you to predict any other growth metric. Let’s see how this works on the product’s revenue forecast:

1. Take an old relevant cohort of users and calculate its month-by-month revenue.
2. Divide the resulting set of values ​​by the size of the cohort (the number of users in the cohort). At this point, you will receive an approximate revenue retention rate for a cohort of users.
3. Using the metric above, you can easily predict what the revenue of a particular cohort of users will be for any month. To do this, you need to multiply the cohort size by the value of the metric calculated in the previous step for the corresponding month.
4. If you need to obtain the dynamics of the predicted metric for months that go beyond what you can get on the basis of the oldest relevant cohorts, you will need to make an assumption about the future dynamics of the metric.

Forecasting metrics for a cohort of users is simple: first we get the data on how this metric changes for some old relevant cohort, and then we assume that other cohorts will have similar dynamics.

## Predicting the size of the future product’s cohorts

The last missing piece for creating a revenue or audience forecast is information about the size of future cohorts of users who will come to your product. That is, creating a forecast for the number of new users.

There is no universal way to predict the future number of new users, since the growth models of different products are fundamentally different.

To solve this problem, you will need to build a forecast of the number of new users for each of the distribution channels, based on the available levers and the limitations each of them has.

## Using Excel / Google Spreadsheet template to project audience numbers, revenue and other product metrics

At this point, we’ve have already discussed:

* How to forecast the number of new users in the future (i.e., estimated size of the future cohorts).
* How to forecast active users, revenue or other metrics for a specific cohort of users.
* How the metrics of user cohorts, selected based on the date users joined the product, make up the metrics of the entire product.

If you understand the logic behind all the above steps, then creating a forecast becomes a solely technical task.

You can find an example template for forecasting product revenue here \[[file](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1atuXlLQSrjIHEoscPeL8un8pbCn-Z_S9YhEg3-qWig8/edit#gid=0)\].

In this file, we forecast revenue for a product that was launched in January 2015. The forecast was made in October 2019. All the actual data in the file is highlighted in blue, and all of the forecast data is highlighted in yellow.

Creating a forecast works as follows:

1. We calculated the month-by-month revenue of the users of the oldest cohort (see row 11 in the file).
2. We divided the result from the previous step by the number of users in the cohort (see row 12 in the file).
3. We made a forecast of the number of new users from October 2019 to the last month that we want to have the forecast for.
4. Based on the vale obtained in step 2, we built a revenue forecast for all product cohorts, created based on the month users started using the product.
5. The only thing left is to add the values ​​of the cohorts in the right way to get the revenue of the whole product in future months.

Read all about how this forecasting approach is applied in practice in a previous essay where I talked about the future of Calm and other subscription-based apps after [the changes made in iOS 13.](https://gopractice.io/blog/change-in-ios-13-that-might-end-calm-1b-valuation/)

## Improving revenue and audience forecasting models for the app

### Make separate forecasts for the key audience segments

One way to improve the quality of forecasts is to calculate individual forecasts for the key segments of the audience.

For example, you can make separate forecasts for different distribution channels or for different markets where your business is represented.

The allocation of individual segments makes sense when the dynamics of the predicted metric in these segments is significantly different, or when the segments are governed by different laws (different levels of competition, different growth drivers). If you do not make forecasts for individual segments, then you may face a problem when the dynamics of the cohort’s metric will strongly depend on the distribution of users by the segments, which can change over time.

### Make sure to consider the future impact of product and marketing changes on the model’s key metrics

If you’re making a forecast for a year or a longer period of time, then it makes sense to consider how the team’s work will affect retention, monetization, and acquisition of new users over the year. Reflecting potential future changes in the model will depend on the kind of changes and the effects you expect from them.

Some companies make forecasts for the basic scenario where they assume there will be no significant changes to the core product metrics. This forecast is considered as the minimum expected level of product growth.

### Add seasonality to the forecast model

When calculating the dynamics of the metric based on the historical data, the seasonal effects are likely to smooth out or disappear. Seasonality has a strong impact in many industries, so it is important to make sure to correctly reflect this in your forecast.

Seasonality can be addressed in one of two ways: Either you can add it at the coefficient level for the total value of the metric for the entire business (coefficients for specific months of the year), or you can factor it in at the level of dynamics of the specific cohorts.

The second option gives a more accurate result, but it is more expensive to implement. The first option is simpler, but in some cases it may poorly reflect the influence of seasonality (especially if the product is going through rapid growth).

### Complete the forecast with other metrics that characterize your business

Often, after building a revenue and audience forecast and other key high-level metrics of your business, you can easily build an expected future P&amp;L or any other kind of reports.

For example, this way you can evaluate the future cash flows of your company, and understand how much money you can invest in new experimental products/projects next year.

## Pitfalls to avoid when forecasting revenue and audience numbers

### Prediction issues for apps with strong long-term retention

If you are working on an app with a stable long-term retention, and you are using a device\_id (device characteristic) as a unique user identifier in the analytics system, then you will encounter a rather unusual problem.

People change phones every year or every year and a half. If you consider a specific user who did this, then at the time of changing his device the following will happen:

* Activity from the original device\_id will disappear, which will be reflected in the data as a decrease in the retention rate.
* If the user installs the product on a new device, a new user will appear in the analytics system with a new device\_id, which will be reflected in the data as the growth of the new users.
* The problem occurs because this supposed “new user” will behave differently than usual new users.

This may seem like a minor problem at first glance, but it will have a strong impact on forecasts for products that have solid long-term retention rates. Forecasts hinge on being able to create accurate user cohorts. Without being able to place users in their respective cohorts, the forecasts made on their behavior will become inaccurate over time.

You can solve this problem by asking users to create an account in your product, so you will be able to identify them when they log in from a new device. You can also use more sophisticated ways to identify users based on their addresses or other data.

Some services make use of an unusual approach and form cohorts based on the moment users make their first purchase. Thus they make forecasts only with the customers and not any user. Everything that happens before the user’s first purchase in this case can be considered as part of a marketing funnel.

Slack uses this approach. This became clear when they published their data before going public. You can read more about Slack and their business model [here](https://gopractice.io/blog/slack-vs-teams-as-we-go-remote/), [here](https://gopractice.io/blog/slack-vs-teams-vs-workplace/) and [here](https://gopractice.io/blog/slack-ipo-reading-between-lines/).

### Your forecast ignores what is not included in the historical data

We used historical data to make forecasts. Therefore, in fact, we got a forecast of what will happen if everything stays the same as it was before.

As we found out during the COVID-19 pandemic, life and the world around us can change quite rapidly, and we cannot take such effects into account in advance. But at the same time, such a forecasting model gives you all the tools to conduct various kinds of stress tests on your product and evaluate their impact on high-level and business metrics.

For example, you can consider a scenario where the influx of the new users will be five times greater in order to assess the impact on the number of active users and understand how many servers you will need to support your product.

## You must have a deep understanding of the product’s growth model to build a high-quality accurate forecast

The described approach to forecasting is quite universal. It works for any metrics and for almost any kind of products and businesses. The quality of the forecast mainly depends on how well you understand your product, its growth model and the internal dynamics of the distribution channels and the market.

It is also crucial to understand that forecasting is a tool for exploring your product, finding the levers to drive key metrics, and conduct stress tests. A good model will allow you to evaluate the impact of various potential projects and development vectors on the topline metrics of your business.",t2_2c30i,How to forecast key product metrics through cohort analysis,,t3_hbeoyt,0.5,0,,0,1592516104.0,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Forecasting the dynamics of revenue, audience, and other key metrics is an important process for any product that is in its growth phase.

&lt;p&gt;The very process of creating a forecasting model allows you to synchronize the team in terms of understanding the product’s growth model. It also provides a tool for assessing the impact of working on different areas of the model.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Understanding the relation between the metrics (audience numbers, retention, revenue, etc.) of individual cohorts and the entire product&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consider the following product, let’s call it X.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;First month after launch&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You launch product X in January 2019. In January (the first month after the launch), 1,000 new users come to the product, and they spend $100.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, in February (the second month after the launch), the product’s MAU will be composed of the February cohort of active users (1,000 people) and what remains of the January cohort (700 retained users). That is, the audience will equal 1,000 + 700 = 1,700 users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Revenue in the second month will be equal to $100 + $70 = $170. It will also encompass the revenue of the two currently available cohorts of users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Third month after launch&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As in previous months, in March, we will add a third cohort of users (people who started using the product in March).The overall metrics will be the sum of metrics for the January, February and March cohorts at the end of March.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Month-N after launch&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we reach the end of month N after the launch, we will have N cohorts of users based on the month the users started using the product. The MAU for the entire product for month N will be equal to the sum of the audiences of each of the available cohorts in month N.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Why did we present the audience and revenue for each month as the sum of these metrics for individual cohorts?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The goal of this exercise was to show that the key metrics of your product in any month are directly determined by their corresponding values ​​in the cohorts of users, created based on the date the users joined the product.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Predicting the dynamics of revenue, audience numbers and other metrics for a specific cohort of users&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Predicting the dynamics of revenue, audience, or any other metric for a particular cohort of users is relatively simple. To do this, you need to use the cohort’s historical data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Usually, you need to take the oldest relevant product cohorts in order to get their actual dynamics, and then project this dynamics to the new cohorts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, to predict a monthly active audience (MAU), you can take the following steps:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Take an old relevant cohort of users and calculate the MAU for this cohort by month. By “relevant” I mean that the cohort must reflect the current state of the product. In this context, a cohort that has existed before a major change to the product does not qualify as relevant.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Divide the resulting set of values ​​by the size of the cohort (the number of users in the cohort). At this step you will obtain the monthly retention rate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using monthly retention, you can easily predict what will be the audience of a particular cohort of users for any month. To do this, multiply the size of the cohort by the retention rate of the corresponding month.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you need to get the dynamics of the predicted metric for months that go beyond what you can get on the basis of the oldest relevant cohorts, you will need to make an assumption about the metric’s future dynamics:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For example, if the cohort’s audience has been steadily decreasing by 3% every month starting from some point in time, then you can assume that the same trend will continue in the upcoming months.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If the metric seems stable, you can assume that it won’t change in the coming months.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is no universal approach to this task. You will need to decide on a case-by-case basis.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s look at how this will work in the example of the app X that we examined earlier in this essay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;We take those who came in January 2019 as an old relevant cohort of users.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based on this cohort, we calculate the monthly retention rate of our product. To do this, we need to divide the audience number by the size of the cohort (1,000 users).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now we can make the MAU forecast of other cohorts for the month we are interested in. For example, the Month 4 MAU of the cohort that came in May 2019 will be equal to the number of users in this cohort multiplied by 4th month retention (1,000 * 70% = 700).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If we want to predict what the cohort’s MAU will be on Month 7, then we will need to assume what will happen with the monthly retention rate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In our case, the task is simple: retention has remained steady since Month 1, so we can assume that it will remain the same in the following months. As we collect more data in the future, we can modify the forecast if we observe any changes to the retention rate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The same procedure will help you to predict any other growth metric. Let’s see how this works on the product’s revenue forecast:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Take an old relevant cohort of users and calculate its month-by-month revenue.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Divide the resulting set of values ​​by the size of the cohort (the number of users in the cohort). At this point, you will receive an approximate revenue retention rate for a cohort of users.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using the metric above, you can easily predict what the revenue of a particular cohort of users will be for any month. To do this, you need to multiply the cohort size by the value of the metric calculated in the previous step for the corresponding month.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you need to obtain the dynamics of the predicted metric for months that go beyond what you can get on the basis of the oldest relevant cohorts, you will need to make an assumption about the future dynamics of the metric.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Forecasting metrics for a cohort of users is simple: first we get the data on how this metric changes for some old relevant cohort, and then we assume that other cohorts will have similar dynamics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Predicting the size of the future product’s cohorts&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last missing piece for creating a revenue or audience forecast is information about the size of future cohorts of users who will come to your product. That is, creating a forecast for the number of new users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is no universal way to predict the future number of new users, since the growth models of different products are fundamentally different.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To solve this problem, you will need to build a forecast of the number of new users for each of the distribution channels, based on the available levers and the limitations each of them has.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Using Excel / Google Spreadsheet template to project audience numbers, revenue and other product metrics&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point, we’ve have already discussed:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How to forecast the number of new users in the future (i.e., estimated size of the future cohorts).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How to forecast active users, revenue or other metrics for a specific cohort of users.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How the metrics of user cohorts, selected based on the date users joined the product, make up the metrics of the entire product.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you understand the logic behind all the above steps, then creating a forecast becomes a solely technical task.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can find an example template for forecasting product revenue here [&lt;a href=""https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1atuXlLQSrjIHEoscPeL8un8pbCn-Z_S9YhEg3-qWig8/edit#gid=0""&gt;file&lt;/a&gt;].&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this file, we forecast revenue for a product that was launched in January 2015. The forecast was made in October 2019. All the actual data in the file is highlighted in blue, and all of the forecast data is highlighted in yellow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Creating a forecast works as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We calculated the month-by-month revenue of the users of the oldest cohort (see row 11 in the file).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We divided the result from the previous step by the number of users in the cohort (see row 12 in the file).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We made a forecast of the number of new users from October 2019 to the last month that we want to have the forecast for.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Based on the vale obtained in step 2, we built a revenue forecast for all product cohorts, created based on the month users started using the product.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The only thing left is to add the values ​​of the cohorts in the right way to get the revenue of the whole product in future months.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Read all about how this forecasting approach is applied in practice in a previous essay where I talked about the future of Calm and other subscription-based apps after &lt;a href=""https://gopractice.io/blog/change-in-ios-13-that-might-end-calm-1b-valuation/""&gt;the changes made in iOS 13.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Improving revenue and audience forecasting models for the app&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Make separate forecasts for the key audience segments&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One way to improve the quality of forecasts is to calculate individual forecasts for the key segments of the audience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, you can make separate forecasts for different distribution channels or for different markets where your business is represented.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The allocation of individual segments makes sense when the dynamics of the predicted metric in these segments is significantly different, or when the segments are governed by different laws (different levels of competition, different growth drivers). If you do not make forecasts for individual segments, then you may face a problem when the dynamics of the cohort’s metric will strongly depend on the distribution of users by the segments, which can change over time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Make sure to consider the future impact of product and marketing changes on the model’s key metrics&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re making a forecast for a year or a longer period of time, then it makes sense to consider how the team’s work will affect retention, monetization, and acquisition of new users over the year. Reflecting potential future changes in the model will depend on the kind of changes and the effects you expect from them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some companies make forecasts for the basic scenario where they assume there will be no significant changes to the core product metrics. This forecast is considered as the minimum expected level of product growth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Add seasonality to the forecast model&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When calculating the dynamics of the metric based on the historical data, the seasonal effects are likely to smooth out or disappear. Seasonality has a strong impact in many industries, so it is important to make sure to correctly reflect this in your forecast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Seasonality can be addressed in one of two ways: Either you can add it at the coefficient level for the total value of the metric for the entire business (coefficients for specific months of the year), or you can factor it in at the level of dynamics of the specific cohorts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second option gives a more accurate result, but it is more expensive to implement. The first option is simpler, but in some cases it may poorly reflect the influence of seasonality (especially if the product is going through rapid growth).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Complete the forecast with other metrics that characterize your business&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Often, after building a revenue and audience forecast and other key high-level metrics of your business, you can easily build an expected future P&amp;amp;L or any other kind of reports.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, this way you can evaluate the future cash flows of your company, and understand how much money you can invest in new experimental products/projects next year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Pitfalls to avoid when forecasting revenue and audience numbers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Prediction issues for apps with strong long-term retention&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are working on an app with a stable long-term retention, and you are using a device_id (device characteristic) as a unique user identifier in the analytics system, then you will encounter a rather unusual problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People change phones every year or every year and a half. If you consider a specific user who did this, then at the time of changing his device the following will happen:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Activity from the original device_id will disappear, which will be reflected in the data as a decrease in the retention rate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If the user installs the product on a new device, a new user will appear in the analytics system with a new device_id, which will be reflected in the data as the growth of the new users.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The problem occurs because this supposed “new user” will behave differently than usual new users.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This may seem like a minor problem at first glance, but it will have a strong impact on forecasts for products that have solid long-term retention rates. Forecasts hinge on being able to create accurate user cohorts. Without being able to place users in their respective cohorts, the forecasts made on their behavior will become inaccurate over time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can solve this problem by asking users to create an account in your product, so you will be able to identify them when they log in from a new device. You can also use more sophisticated ways to identify users based on their addresses or other data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some services make use of an unusual approach and form cohorts based on the moment users make their first purchase. Thus they make forecasts only with the customers and not any user. Everything that happens before the user’s first purchase in this case can be considered as part of a marketing funnel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Slack uses this approach. This became clear when they published their data before going public. You can read more about Slack and their business model &lt;a href=""https://gopractice.io/blog/slack-vs-teams-as-we-go-remote/""&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=""https://gopractice.io/blog/slack-vs-teams-vs-workplace/""&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=""https://gopractice.io/blog/slack-ipo-reading-between-lines/""&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Your forecast ignores what is not included in the historical data&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We used historical data to make forecasts. Therefore, in fact, we got a forecast of what will happen if everything stays the same as it was before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we found out during the COVID-19 pandemic, life and the world around us can change quite rapidly, and we cannot take such effects into account in advance. But at the same time, such a forecasting model gives you all the tools to conduct various kinds of stress tests on your product and evaluate their impact on high-level and business metrics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, you can consider a scenario where the influx of the new users will be five times greater in order to assess the impact on the number of active users and understand how many servers you will need to support your product.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;You must have a deep understanding of the product’s growth model to build a high-quality accurate forecast&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The described approach to forecasting is quite universal. It works for any metrics and for almost any kind of products and businesses. The quality of the forecast mainly depends on how well you understand your product, its growth model and the internal dynamics of the distribution channels and the market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is also crucial to understand that forecasting is a tool for exploring your product, finding the levers to drive key metrics, and conduct stress tests. A good model will allow you to evaluate the impact of various potential projects and development vectors on the topline metrics of your business.&lt;/p&gt;

1. Integrates with a single line of code to your website
2. Finds the right metrics, analyzes the data, and creates graphs
3. Gives solutions like change the color of your features block or replace persona block with features block, etc. You can implement those solutions to increase your conversion rate. These solutions were basic examples but AI automatically gives them after analyzing it.

I will not post the site due to obvious reasons, and plus that it is not in English. This is E-Commerce Website, which focuses on gardening tools, like sprinkles, hoses, wooden houses, birds houses, seeds, plants, carports, everything for the home and garden basically. What I noticed is:  


1.They dont use GA, but another tool - Webtrends. Also no Facebook Pixel, which since they are in E-Commerce is a must, having in mind the recent deal between Facebook and Shopify. Always better to be prepared from early on, then to catch up later.

2.Not optimized for my resolution (screen zoom by default by laptop with 25% to 125%), so maybe deeper research on segment groups with this resolution and if there are higher bounce rates from the homepage or issues with the purchasing process. I cannot possibly go through all the pages, and maybe there is some behavioral pattern to be observed with users with such resolution, which is also the most popular in that country (found statistics, more than 14% use it). Also experiment with various OS, maybe MAC devices do not zoom in by default. It looked well on my other screen and phone.  


3.Homepage too heavy (too many pictures, categories, etc.) to navigate and differentiate through the various categories, I spent a lot of time (20-30) sec to figure out which one is a product category and what is a blog post, which gives advice on how to plan your trees correctly or how to select the best car port. I suggested using a price label on every category (f.e. starting at 99USD), this would be easier for the eyes, especially having in mind that the customer base is likely older (&gt;45 maybe even &gt;50). This demographic info is easy available through their databases and GA.  


4.HeatMap of customers to see how far they scroll down, how much time do they spend there (to see if these categories and stuff are really that hard to understand), maybe they flock to the search function immediately?  


4.Search bar is in the middle, while it ideally should be on the right or left. It still could expand through the middle, since it shows images and categories (very good search function if I have to be honest). I suggested looking through the searches and establishing new categories or top searches for the season / week, if there is enough data to figure out a trend.  


5.Where do the customers come from, is there a difference in the Landing Pages? I want to look at product pages with have higher exit / bounce rate and compare them to similar products, which convert better. Maybe the one has too much / too little info, and this can be optimized when building the new website.  


6.What is the traffic from pictures? Their pictures were randomly named f.e. asiud1123asx.jpg and no alt-tag. I suggested naming them with a brand and some specifications. f.e. when it is electrical equipment its power (15W), and if it is a hose, its length and color, just to get an idea.  


7.Purchasing process - is there a step which takes a little bit too long? I experimented with a test order, everything went smoothly, maybe the new web page should pop up with Street suggestions, so people do not mess them up (some are complicated). This would result in easier shipping and less shipment mistakes, even though they would have been caused up by the customer.  


8. Too big icons for payment and shipping methods, they looked like separate categories.  


9.Some E-Commerce statistics for the (converting) customers - is there a difference between landing pages for those who convert or not, how much time did they spent on the website, how many searches did they perform? Maybe customers who find their desired product with two searches are more likely to order than those who performed 3 searches and up.  Maybe converting customers are landing on ""more simplified"" webpages. Here I again have the homepage in mind, which is very hard to use and understand.

&lt;p&gt;I hope this will help other candidates who might go through the same procedure.&lt;br/&gt;
I went through an interview for Junior Analytics Advisor position, with a local (probably the best agency) in the country where I am.    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The interview went well, I would say, with a minor fuck up on my side. They asked me some questions, but used GA terms in their language, and I have used and learnt the tool in English, so I needed a bit time or gave a wrong answer (once) and once an answer which was not that full. Still they sent me a task which I had to complete and send it to them. It looks like that:  &lt;/p&gt;

Last  week I had a post “Interested in connecting with Data job recruiters”  and a post about looking for a junior to mid-level SQL data analyst.   Included in the search would also be finding  a non-profit organization as well to begin the data analyst journey  with. I have heard that this is a great way to gain some experience  while helping at the same time.   

Does anyone have suggestions on the best way to find a non-profit to approach do data support for? 

Is there a common type of problem or pain point non-profits have, that data support could help with?  

I  do have experience both in my current role and the one prior with ""work  from home"" / remote, and have experience using GoToMeeting, RingCentral, Teams Meeting, Slack, Skype and Zoom. 

Started learning Oracle &amp; PostgreSQL about 2 years ago. 

PowerBI including DAX about 2 years ago. 

Python and R language 4-5 years ago. 

And, I am currently working on an advanced exercise for DAX. 

Ultimately,  I want to work in a remote arrangement, but it doesn't have to be in  this first position and I am willing to relocate to anywhere. I am  currently in the SF bay area.

\- No privacy popup box

\- Smaller Code (quicker landing page load times)

\- Open Source

\- Simple stats. It might sound counter-intuitive, but Google Analytics tracks about 300 data points on every site user, which is an overkill. We have noticed that we have used about 12 out of those 300.

\- Ability to video record sessions. This is arguably one of the most important tools, as we just realized that we had a popup box on our landing page that was covering the ""Signup"" button on some Andoid phones. After replaying the session replays, we have realized that our conversions have gone up from 13% to about 20% on mobile phones. That is huge.

\- Heatmaps. We can see the hottest zones on any page. This is especially great when we perform A/B tests with two different landing pages.

\- There aren't many cons, but one of them is not an extremely precise tracking of users with PrivateAnalytix vs Google Analytics. Let me explain, Google uses cookies to track users (this is what mainly creates privacy issues). 

PrivateAnalytix doesn't use cookies and doesn't collect any user identifiable information. So if the same person from the same IP visits the site, PrivateAnalytics will think count this as 2 visits. 

Hope this helps you guys. I was fed up with privacy concerns of Google Analytics. Though it is free, they sell user information to their partners. PrivateAnalytix doesn't store PII, we own the data, we can do session replays and heatmaps.

r/analytics,"I'll elaborate a bit - so - we have an issue for our ecomm site where our 'forgot password' email 'steals' last click attribution from our other channels. e.g - someone clicks from a facebook ad, goes to sign in, forgets their password, resets, then clicks through the email they received to reset their password. This means the original last click source (in this case, Facebook) gets overridden to Email.

The domain referral exclusion list could work, but would then block all other attribution from whatever domain the email click throughs come from.

So in short ... Is there a way to configure GA to 'ignore' a click through from a specific UTM?

To illustrate..

**Current attribution:**

* Google - first click
* Facebook - 2nd click
* Email forgot password link - 3rd and last click --&gt; Sale goes to 'Email'

**Desired attribution:**

* Google - first click
* Facebook - 2nd click
* Email forgot password link - GA configured to ignore the UTM and treat the prior click 'Social' as the last click attribution source.
* \--&gt; Sale goes to 'Facebook'

I'm working for a small start up as the head of marketing performance. We're an entertainment app publisher and facing volatile performance right now. 

Relevant for context, before I start going into my initial question:
our app is tied with in-app credits, they're needed to use the key feature (entertainment) of the app. Every action needs 20 credits, the user get's 5 free credits per day for the login, 60 for the start, and we do offer a slot machine, with a free game per day, to win additional credits (first game of the day will most likely be a win of 3 credits). 

Unfortunately Google kicked us out of the Google Playstore, and we cut off the slot-feature, with our latest update. iOS users can still use the feature but new acquired android users (and older cohorts who update the app) can't use the feature now.

We do not have a bi-manager or data analyst in the team, so I'm trying to figure out things by myself. I was thinking about drawing correlation between the whole free credit contingent per day and the free credits won with the slot machine per day.

I'm relatively new to data science, and I'm currently working on building a model to predict downstream ammonium concentrations, based on concentrations at two other stations. I thought to use multiple linear regression. However, I noticed that there is heteroskedasticity in my residual plot. I've read that I could use weighted linear regression to correct this, but I wanted to be sure that linear regression is the right model to use first. Does anyone have any experience with modeling this type of data? If it does call for a linear regression, can two stations that are highly correlated to each other still be used? I know that one of the assumptions of linear regression is that the independent variables shouldn't be too correlated. Thanks!

My background is in SQL development, ETL and reporting.  I'd say my specialty is in manipulating and transforming customer data from client data sets into  CRM databases.  I've got great SQL and Excel skills. I've done what I consider to be very basic post marketing campaign analysis in Excel (mainly calculating response rates and ROI from predetermined segments). I'm completely self taught.


I have been asked to do a project. The first part is easy. I'll be determing the completeness of data and getting it all linked up and variables flagged in a single flat table structure.


Once this is done the client wants analysis done to segment people into groups based on there likelihood to pay on time, likelihood to respond to digital communications, etc).

I unfortunately don't have a background in statistics but the company doesn't have anyone else to do the segmentation and wants me to do it.

r/analytics,"Just wondering how do you go about A/B testing price on an e-commerce site? I have used 2 methods both with drawbacks. Was wondering what alternatives you guys have.

**Method 1:** If I use Google Optimize, I am able to change the price a user sees.

Original: Price on page = $10

Variant 1: Price on page = $20

*Problem with Method 1:* However, even if I edit the page to show $20 when a user clicks Add to Cart, they would still add the $10 version of the product. Clearly, this is not ideal for testing purposes since I want to see how many users actually checked out at the $20 price point.

**Method 2:** Have different landing pages that show different products. Using my e-commerce plugin (WooCommerce), I can then add different prices for the same product (ie. add the same product twice just that they have different prices). This way the price a user sees is actually what is added to their cart.

Original (on homepage.com): Price on page = $10

Variant 1 (on homepage.com/variant1): Price on page = $20

*Problem with Method 2:* A user who lands on the $20 page can easily go back to the homepage ( to find that they are actually being charged more). This sounds like it would lead to negative customer experience.

r/analytics,"Hi everyone,

Before I start, a little bit of context :)

Age: 29

Country: Spain

&amp;#x200B;

Academic Background: BSc in Economics by the Pompeu Fabra University in Barcelona (Well positioned university in Europe with a strong Math/Stats program) and a Master Degree in Marketing Management (Once I finish my studies I realized that I was more interested in business and strategy rather than Economics)

&amp;#x200B;

Professional Background: B2B Product Marketing Manager in a Tech Multinacional Company. Full-time job.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm currently aware about how the world if changing and I'm realizing that a more queantitative set of skills will make my profile more competitive in the labor market even if I'm not into a pure technical career. I'm currently interested in Marketing, Business and Strategy, and if it's possible, I'd like to keep my career focus in these fields, however, everytime I go to Linkedin and other Job Websites I see that having such sets of skills will we quite useful for futures jobs, even though these aren't BI/BA specific jobs, but it's always useful an analytical profile with a complete set of skills focused on SQL, R, Python, Excel...

&amp;#x200B;

At first I thought on starting in getting BA/BI skills by myself such as learning SQL, R (did some back in my university days) and Python. Then go deeper on Excel and some Data Visualization programs like Power BI or Tableau. Go directly for the skills I need. However, in these days I though that perhaps getting a second BSc in CS will be ever more helpful in the long term even though I'm not interested in technical jobs, but more business and strategic ones.

&amp;#x200B;

The thing about this is that I'm not a 18-20 year old guy anymore with no responsabilities. If I start to study CS I will have to do it while I'm in my full-time current job. In Spain BS and BA have a duration of 4 years, which means that if I'm get into this I will take at least 6-8 years to get the Bachelor taking into account that I work 8 hours minimum every day and it takes about 2 hours to travel home from work and vice versa. I don't think that I will have enough time to go a course by yeear. I wouldn't hesitate to do that if I was a bit younger, and even if a had a part-time job like working in a pizza corner or something like that, but right now if I take this decision I need to be aware that I will finish my degree with 35-37 years the BS in CS. However, If I do it I will have a very complete profile.

&amp;#x200B;

I think the point at which a decision is good is when the benefit / cost ratio is high. It is evident that the cost of taking this decision for me according to my circumstances will be high (not so much economically) in terms of time, effort, sacrificing free time to go to the gym, staying with my girlfriend, and other hobbies taking into account that I'll have to work in a serious full-time job while I'm studying a STEM Degree. The question is, will the benefit be as much or higher than the cost based on the fact that my interest continues to continue working in Marketing, Strategy and Business, but I would simply like to have a more technical profile?

&amp;#x200B;

Should I focus on getting profisiency in a set of skills that the labor market is demanding like the ones I previously mentioned or will be better in the long run getting a Bachelor in CS even though I'm still interested in Business and Marketing?",t2_ujszb,Thinking of getting a BSc in CS.

I have a list of shopping items with multiple variables (revenue, price, review quantity, and rating) and I'm not sure what is the best way to come up with a single ranking for those items.

I've tried a linear regression but I couldn't find a ""reasonable"" weight for each variable. Also, normalising the data gave me some distortions due to outliers.

I want to avoid having items that excel in just one variable to be on top of the ranking.

The only way I came up with was by splitting the items into quartiles for the first variable, then repeating the quartile split for each cluster considering a second variable and then repeating the process for the third and fourth variables (4&gt;16&gt;64&gt;256 clusters).
At the end, the top items would be those that were in the top quartile for every variable, followed by the items that were in the top quartile for 3 variables but in the 2nd quartile for the last variable and so on...

r/analytics,"Hi all,

Last time I posted here I was looking for help with getting customer quality data from WooCommerce blended with the source they came in from, for a subscription-model client. What I needed to do was see how the ad group/campaign that converted a user affected their lifetime revenue, retention rate, and so on, so we can make better-informed decisions about the quality of each ad campaign.

&amp;#x200B;

To do that, I used the transaction ID within Google Ads as the join key to tie to the Trial ID within WooCommerce and visualized it within Data Studio. That's how we figured out the Google Ads data, and now I can browse number of cancellations, renewals, cancellation rates, average number of renewals, e.t.c on an individual ad level.

&amp;#x200B;

Now I'm trying to figure out a way to do the same for Facebook/Instagram Ads. Unfortunately, the same set up won't work, because some of the metrics I'd need to get data on an ad set/individual ad level aren't allowed in blended data by Google.

2. Conception of digital analytics solutions and strategies as well as ongoing support and improvement for our customers
3. Website traffic and campaign analysis and recommendations for our customers
4. Working close with out  Programmatic Marketing Team 
5. Research and ideas presentation
6. GAIQ would be lovely, but not a necessity  - **I have it GAIQ + some Google Ads certification**
7. Knowledge of Data Analysis with Excel -  **Not proficient, have done it in the past, but I can manage everything very fast through research**
8. Visualization with Tableau / Data Studio would be nice, but not necessity - **I have little experience with Tableau, can catch up rather quickly.**
9. Digital Marketing Know-How - **I am pretty good here**

&amp;#x200B;

I would be happy to get some tips regarding the interview. Now, have in mind that the HR loves me due to my past experience, so I have a plus here. I have GAIQ, but the thing is, I have not practiced it a lot - just like a language, I need a bit to master it, and once I start playing with it, I am confident I will get under its skin. I am usually quite modest about myself, but really, Digital Native is underestimation.  


The first interview will be with the HR, I guess there will be second one with a guy leading the Digital Analytics team, where I might need to show a skill or two of mine. It will likely be in a week from now.

I really do not know what the tasks look like in such a position. Is it like ""**Here is website A, take a look at GA and tell us what inefficiencies are to be found"", or being a Junior, I would be getting exact tasks, given by a higher ranked employee?** Input from people working in the field will be appreciated. Am I expected to start and be perfect from the very beginning? Knowing myself handling other tools, If I am doing this full time I should be at very advanced level in two to maximum three weeks.

&amp;#x200B;

**Can you guys think of any questions that might come during the interview?**

 There are other SEO / SEM Junior positions available too. I guess since I am favored by the HR she will try to find me a place, realizing my potential, he will want to ""help me"", if he thinks I am better fit there.  Is Junior in that field considered ""Trainee"" where you have a month or two of onboarding period before being on your own? I am kind of lost, and while all these answers will likely be answered during the first interview with the HR, I would like to hear some inputs.

r/analytics,"Hello i'm a biologist in the pharma industry working as a data analyst

Scenario: Had to merge and de-duplicate 5 excel tables from different providers. Data is very similar but each provider uses their own dictionaries (drug1, drug001, drg-01). As an excel user with little-to-no vba experience, i dont have other options than checking data manually and it is very time consuming.

I wanted to automate the process a bit and the best solution i came up with was to setting up this process in mySQL, in order to 1) import the excel tables 2) pattern/fuzzy match the data 3) Present an already de-duplicated output with a data provider count, in order to quantify how many times a drug is indexed across databases (kinda like a quality check)

I'd be willing to learn mySQL and do it myself but i realize its a lot of work (took me hours just to import 2 out of 5 tables using the mysql wizard in excel) so am considering hiring someone to get the job done. My idea is to build a cross-checking and reporting system to reduce analysis lead times from days to hours.

My question would be, is mysql the best choice for this task or are there other innovative solutions i should consider?

&lt;p&gt;I wanted to automate the process a bit and the best solution i came up with was to setting up this process in mySQL, in order to 1) import the excel tables 2) pattern/fuzzy match the data 3) Present an already de-duplicated output with a data provider count, in order to quantify how many times a drug is indexed across databases (kinda like a quality check)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;d be willing to learn mySQL and do it myself but i realize its a lot of work (took me hours just to import 2 out of 5 tables using the mysql wizard in excel) so am considering hiring someone to get the job done. My idea is to build a cross-checking and reporting system to reduce analysis lead times from days to hours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My question would be, is mysql the best choice for this task or are there other innovative solutions i should consider?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit: Added a sample of data with two drugs&lt;/p&gt;

r/analytics,"Hey all,

Hoping for some sound advice as I realise I might be in a terrible situation (or not - hoping you can assess it) in my career.

For the past 5 years I've been working with Qlik products and became somewhat of an expert at it.

The problem is, I've become so much of an expert that I can't confidently say I am good at anything else (e.g. other products such as Tableau, PowerBI etc) because I haven't delivered work in any other tools in the past 5 years.

In one way it's great because I am usually at the top when it comes to work projects around Qlik. But the down side is I have placed all of my eggs in one basket. The COVID19 situation has made me realise how exposed I am if there is no work besides this product.

So how do I dig myself out of this and diversify? Any advice?

Skills wise:

- Working in Business Intelligence.

- Expert level understanding of how to script in Qlik for data modelling and design.

- SQL (SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, CREATE, COMMENT)

- Dimensional modelling concepts (e.g. Star Schema, Snowflake) having modelled this way for Qlik data models.

- Server configuration (e.g. clustering and multi-node server deployments for Qlik)

- Training and coaching juniors in the above for less experienced developers.

- Presenting, documentation (data specs, diagrams, training documentation, slide-decks, storytelling using data) etc.

- Consulting clients on the product, making performance better etc.

- Visualisation design best practices

- Trained many hundreds of people so can understand nuances of how people learn.

Overall I have 10 years experience in tech.

I am feeling very nervous about my situation and don't know what to do next so would appreciate any sound advice you may have.

Due to my unemployment I've been using LinkedIn and have noticed how so many people are so expert in so many products. I don't know if they are exaggerating or if it's genuinely the case so maybe this is also playing into my in-adequateness lately.

My aspiration is to become maybe less-hands on and go into roles which require a mixture of technical skills, working with people, presentations, and has elements of marketing. I believe my experience over the 10 years covers many of this, the problem is I am a specialist in a propertary software maybe?

For now I am happy to continue working on technical roles to keep bring food on the table for my family but I am acutely aware of the dangers of continuing down my current path.

To try and fight this, during my unemployment I have been learning on my own:

- Microsoft Power BI

- Cloud data warehousing tools.

- Python programming.

- Reading in general.


I'd really appreciate any advice on how to put myself in a better position in my career, or if you think I am overly anxious I'd appreciate an outside perspective.

r/analytics," 

I want to test for difference in average time per action between 2 groups. I have data on total time per day and total actions per day over a period of days, ex: time = 120 and actions = 45 for Jan 1.

I was wondering what is the best way to average and compare the data. I was just finding the average( tn/an) (example below) for the range of dates and comparing between the groups using a t test with equal variance. However I think another way to calculate average is more appropriate to find the average time per action for each group. My example of why:

&amp;#x200B;

|Day|Time|Action|
|:-|:-|:-|
|1|5|1|
|2|5|5|

The original average I did: average is (5/1+5/5) / 2 = 3 time per action.

However I think I should be using actions as the denominator since I want time per action. So it would be: (5+5) / (1+5) = 10/6 or 1.67 time per action. I feel like the second method is the best way to find the average time per action. However, I want to compare these 2 groups using a test test and I am unsure how to do that and what N should be to accurately test for significant difference, since my data is collected by day and not by individual action.

Any advice is welcome as is tips on how to do this is Excel or stata.

Long story short, I was lucky enough in having the opportunity to take a foreign masters degree on a full scholarship, but then the quarantine happened.

&lt;p&gt;As stated in the title, I&amp;#39;ve joined a pre-launch startup in the CPG space - we&amp;#39;re launching on e-commerce and retail, and the biggest thing we want to pin down now is the ability to TRACK every customer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have several different touchpoints - Social media (FB/Instagram posts &amp;amp; ads), Mailchimp (email marketing), a Shopify hosted website (to purchase the bars) and an SMS service (to communicate with our customers).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How can I have the ability to synthesize all of these touchpoints into one place to analyze traffic/conversions and pull up user &amp;quot;profiles,&amp;quot; showing every contact we&amp;#39;ve had with a certain user (perhaps the latter calls for a more complicated answer... maybe a CRM like Salesforce)? &lt;strong&gt;We will also be offering a free trial that rolls into a subscription, so we want to be able to track the free trial conversion rates and subscriber churn.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Can all of this be done in Google Analytics or other services? Salesforce for user profiles? Or should I look into first putting all of our data (Mailchimp, FB/IG, Shopify) into a Data Warehouse, then using something like Mixpanel (or Tableau/Power BI)? Thanks.&lt;/p&gt;

We're trying to clean up out website. So we're using our web analytics tool to see, which pages have none or few visits. We think it is a good start for finding pages, that can be deleted.
 
But we have discovered that the web analytics tool have registered a lot of the pages two or more times. Usually due to redirects (which are generated automatic by our CMS, whenever there's the slightest change in a pages name/url).
 
That makes it quite hard to use the web analytics tool to clean up our site. Because pages, that seems to have none or few visits, in fact can have a lot of visits - but under different urls.
 
The company behind the web analytics tool are not helpfull; ""it's your own fault due to bad url-behavior"".
 
So at this point, it is a really difficult task to clean up our website.
 
Am i honestly a bit surprised, that the data from the web analytics tools are so full of ""noise"". Shouldn't it be possible for a web analytics tool to only count the final landing pages - and leave out all the redirecting pages?

r/analytics,"Hi,

Thanks for accepting me in the subreddit!

So here's my question - I made a HTML game (in Twine engine) and added GA code to be able to track the number of people playing. The game is online, and the tracking works very well. The problem starts with how I distribute the game. Basically - there is one central place where I host it, but for marketing purposes I encourage people to put it on their servers too, or other websites with games of similar type. I just want the game to be available on as many places as possible, as my main source of income is Patreon.

So basically here's the main issue - the game is played on multiple different domains and all the domains share the same analytics, and it's hard to differentiate the traffic of my main domain, from the traffic of other domains.

What makes things even more complicated - is that in the game there's a check for new version, that contacts my main domain, and if the new version is available on my main domain - it displays a button in the game that redirects player to my main domain where he can play the newest version. And this is an important feature, because I want people play the game on my main domain as much as possible, because at some point I want to add ads. But this makes the thing even more complicated, because I don't know whether someone started playing on the other host, and than maybe moved to the main host, or is he playing on the other host the entire time? 

So here's my questions:

1. How do I check the traffic ONLY on my main domain, excluding those other domains?
2. How do I check the traffic ONLY on one of the other domains?
3. How do I check which of the other domains has most redirection to my central domain?

Sorry if it's confusing, I'm trying my best;)GM",t2_3607vkjs,"Multiple hosts, how to differentiate impressions and refferals",analytics,t3_gkugmw,0.67,1,Google Analytics,1,1589663670.0,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi,&lt;/p&gt;

Hello Experts,

&amp;#x200B;

I am new to OBIEE tool , hence kindly bear with me if my query is basic in nature.

I have 2 RPD files, a.rpd and b.rpd. I need to switch between these 2 RPDs on same server and through same OBIEE tool.

Do I need to deploy both RPD on server to switch between these two through same OBIEE tool?

&amp;#x200B;

As per my own attempt, I can open both RPD file through Administration (obiee tool) : File --&gt; Open--&gt;Offline and without any deployment.

&amp;#x200B;

Is it mandatory to deploy both RPD at server to open it on line?

&amp;#x200B;

I guess I need to define 2 different ODBC system data sources for my repositories after deployment.

Apologies for long post - my first one! A bit of context, I recently quit my full time job. I was in accounting/audit (Canadian CA, CPA) and had moved into a more consulting/advisory role, with a total of about 7 years of experience at a B4 in Canada and Australia. I'm trying to pivot into the data science world and after some research (plus given my past experience as well as interest), I'd like to explore more of the data analyst/business intelligence route. I spent the last couple of weeks learning Python (finished Dr. Chuck's Python for Everybody Specialization on Coursera) and am planning to learn the basics of SQL and Tableau next. In terms of interest, base on the little exposure I have so far, I probably will have a bit more interest in Tableau (generally have enjoyed playing around with the visual aesthetics in PowerPoint presentations and telling stories from a visual perspective - don't think it's something I am particularly good at but am definitely looking to upscale this part the most).

Still working on defining what it is exactly that I am working towards but this is kind of the start. Would like to be in a position where I could use data to drive decision-making in more of an operations standpoint and away from finance/reporting but understand that finance/reporting is where I may need to start off. I also understand that I will most likely need to drop a level or two down from a manager position.

***My questions:***

1. What is the best/most efficient way to upscale? For example, I now know at a basic level how Python works but I don't think I can independently scrape a page. Should I take a more intermediate course or try to do a simple project to start with?
2. For SQL and Tableau, I'd previously taken a few beginner courses online but will probably need a bit more practice. Am planning on taking advantage Tableau's 90 day free learning. Similar to Q1, do I do a bit more self learning or start a small project?
3. How technical do I really need to get if I want to go more of the data analyst/business intelligence route? I know I won't be anywhere as experienced as the technical DS but figured it'd be good to have a basic understanding and working knowledge. I know that my strengths to move into this field will really be the soft skills and business acumen - figured that I would need to build up some technical capabilities.
4. Would it be useful to also brush up on stats and calculus? I've only done the basic Business Stats and Calc courses in university.
5. Is there even a need for this type of role? Any recommendations of what type of jobs there are? So far I've seen Data Analytics consulting groups within the B4 and other marketing/consulting agencies.
6. Any other advice is also greatly appreciated!

r/analytics,"Hi all. I've got a report to create within Data Studio and there's a column I need that I don't know how to get.

&amp;#x200B;

**Background**

Trying to see if acquisition method (like keyword, or UTMs) affects the quality of a customer: lifetime value, retention rate, e.t.c.

**Data**

I'm using a CSV from WooCommerce with the customer records and a direct import from Google Analytics. This data has to be joined by the Transaction ID in GA/Trial ID in WooCommerce to get it to blend in Google Data Studio.

&amp;#x200B;

**Issue** 

So, this report has 'Keyword' as the main dimension in a standard table. I need two more columns to connect to this: one with an aggregate of the ACTIVE subscriptions, and another with the aggregate of the CANCELLED subscriptions.

This data comes from a 'subscription status' column, which contains one of two values: 'cancelled' or 'active.' 

What I'm trying to do, and what I think I should be able to do, is use REGEX in a calculated metric column to count each 'cancelled' value and each 'active' value and express them as an aggregate: something like​

CASE     

WHEN REGEXP\_MATCH(Subscription Status, "".\*(cancelled).\*"")  THEN 1    

ELSE 0

END

The only problem is that this gets listed as a 'valid' formula before I hit apply, but then throws up system errors every single time. I've tried a number of variations on the above but hit the same problem no matter what I try.

I have User-ID feature enabled in my GA with session unification ON.

But when I publish Custom Event from the Server through the API (this needs to be done from server), With only passing User-ID That event is only showing inside User-ID View.

My question is is this expected? Or should I publish the Event from the Client directly through API with User-Id, or Session Unification will do the job and I'll only have 1 event showing instead of two, meaning that it will figure out that Event is actually associated to that specific User?

An important metric for my online web application is Monthly Active Users. So it's not simply how many people access the application each month, but how many of those are deemed 'active' by my own arbitrary standards.

I don't know how this is possible in GA. I can get a list of people that have accessed my site, but I don't know how to segment them by actions performed.

I have a fitness application, and so an active user is someone who may:

\- Update their progress X times a week

\- Perform Y workouts a week

\- Or just check in Z times a week

r/analytics,"Hi guys, I'm a student and have a big analytics project as part of a final. I'm very good at modeling and post-processing but am a bit weak at pre-processing. In order to make sure everything goes smoothly I'd like to make sure I'm correctly identifying datasets attributes as numerical vs categorical.

[Dataset (Google Drive)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ag3lAM-KbNjtwlXuMm8l6OkRwPRxI-lo/view?usp=sharing)

I've highlighted the attributes as per the classification I believe they are:

Green = Numerical

Yellow = Categorical

Red = Output

&amp;#x200B;

**My big questions regard attributes Q6, Q7, Q35, Q36, &amp; Q37.**

**Q6**:  I believe this is **categorical** because hours seems to be on a scale of \[less than 1 hour, 1 hour, 2 hours, 3 hours, 4 hours, 5 hours, more than 6 hours\]. If not for the scale (finite options for survey it would be continuous)

**Q7**: I believe this to be **categorical**.  While it's a number, it may be categorical as it seems to be on a finite scale of \[0,1, 2, 3, 4+\] 

**Q35, Q36, &amp; Q37**: I don't understand these attributes as they're responses to ""Do you have any kids? - Yes/No \_\_\_"". On the surface they appear binary (Yes, No) and thus **categorical** but the max values for these attributes are 6, 7 &amp; 9 respectively perhaps indicating they are **continuous**. Perhaps you can infer what this really means. Perhaps it means for example ""Yes I have 6 kids that ride mountain bikes"". 

What really throws me is when a subject indicates they have kids by entering a value for Q35 and/or Q36, but simultaneously indicates they don't have kids by entering in a value for Q37. As of right now I'm going with **continuous** (numerical).

PREFACE:
Consumerism is reaching a critical halt with the pandemic this therefore presents a problem for us aspiring brand entrepreneurs. The fashion industry is one of the markets suffering the most from this economical shift. With the following passage I will address two phenomena that inherently are affecting the fashion world.The first is a social economical stand point and the second is the “drake culture vulture” circumstance.


-A RIFT HAS BEEN CREATED ONCE AGAIN-

High end fashion and regular fast fashion are gonna have an enormous rift between these two industries.Why? The masses can’t spend their income on “extra things”.In 2018 consumerism was at an all time high ,that which separated high end with low end was non-existent.Accessible to all masses ,the rich were rich so who gives a fuck ,the middle class was wealthy and the lower class was able to be indebted cause of low interest rates in the majority of countries . Those interest rates are gonna sky rocket in these next months ,why ?

The banks need money cause they’re too busy giving loans to the majority businesses cause If you haven’t noticed ,there’s no consumerism in non dispensable products.The companies that pertain to these niches they’re all f-ing broke.Covid is bad but it’s triggered a bigger flu that could ever be contained.

Pretty much “An immense rift between high end fashion and low end fashion has segregated them once again”

-Formal informality potentially will be the next wave-

Taking into consideration the aforementioned.This now allows distinguished designers too expend more on lavish materials.Cause now their market shall be directed towards the high end buyers.More expensive materials , higher end cloths ,cuts that suit the wealthy(formality).The fashion market hasn’t been able to shift away from the typical graphic tees that have dominated the market since the 2010’s that deter from unique cut and sews.Perhaps this could be seen as a necessary evolution leaving behind the standard of mediocrity that has saturated the fashion world.

Ok now so the second is Drake “The culture vulture” it’s pretty apparent that celeb pop culture has a big influence on what we see as “desirable”. Drake Champaign papi ,this dude whatever he touches turns to gold now ,why cause he’s drake ! You cannot lie that he as an individual has had an influence on pop culture ,which ultimately translates into our daily lives as a society.

Drake up until recently has changed his market direction towards the uk grime scene ,he’s with other dudes now you can say which then transforms drake. The uk is becoming a power house for both music innovation and fashion innovation where high end brands like: 
Montcler,Heliot Emil , Aylx,Acw and the biggest one Stone Island seem to dominate this scene .Drake has notability been seen in his most previous music videos ONLY SPORTING THESE NEW UP AND COMING BRANDS , on his new song he mentions Alyx in his CHORUS ,now everybody is gonna be saying alyx and that’s Promotion bub! 
This will only help these brands become the center point of fashion trendsetters.

In conclusion I’d like to state that; with the nuances of technology and easily accessible softwares , globalization of markets.In our current era never has it been more easy to become an entrepreneur. The latter is that , the standard consequently must be raised to avoid saturation, only allowing the truly innovative a platform so they may define this generations art of expression .This may sound Darwinistic but I feel that the same way nature disposes of the weak so should this market aspire to accomplish.

Everybody may have something to convey but not everything can be felt due to its disillusive intention.Seek within but also seek outside ones-self to determine what value you may offer.

I have am trying to blend the data of 2 different data sources, one is data from Facebook ads in a google sheet, and the other is data from Google ads via Google Data Studio's direct connector.

The 2 platforms have slightly different naming for example the Google ads metric is called cost while the Facebook ads metric is called amount spent. There are also other examples like clicks vs link clicks and conversions vs custom conversions etc.

I am supposed to show the media spend data in a bar chart graph to compare media spend weekly, but after blending the data, I see 2 labels in the legend, one says cost and one says amount spent.

I used ""day"" as a join key. But how do i change it such that the legend labels are Google Ads Spend and Facebook ads Spend instead?

r/analytics,"Hi everyone, here's a quick background on my situation: I recently graduated in December with a BS in Finance and minors in Comp Sci and Business Analytics. I've been working 2 internships the past year or so, both of which have mostly involved Power BI, SQL, and Excel doing a lot of ad hoc reporting, writing queries/making views, and some forecasting. 

One of the companies I had been working with was pretty inconsistent work, working on projects remotely every couple months when they need me. They had been paying me $17.50/hr (1099 so closer to $15/hr) as a student/intern, which was fine at the time, but I feel like now that I have a year or so of experience and a degree under my belt that my time is worth significantly more.

My boss from said company hit me up yesterday for the first time in a few months and said he had a new Power BI project for me which I fully intend on accepting but I want to ask for a raise and I'm hoping someone can give me advice:

1. How do I word this request? Do I need to explain myself and talk about how I'm more experienced/efficient, how I feel like my time is worth more than $17.50 an hour at this point? I think he knows how cheap that is for analytics work but I also still consider myself somewhat of a beginner. 
2. How much should I ask for? I was thinking around $25-30/hr but I'm not sure if that's too big of a jump from my previous rate of 17.50. I also am currently very desperate for any work I can get so I would hate for him to be like ""Well for $30/hr I can just do it myself""

r/analytics,"I'm a recent advanced science (pre-medical) undergrad from Sydney, Australia and have been leaning more and more towards becoming a data analyst over this past year. 

I'll try and keep this short and sweet; the huge volumes of information on how to become a data analyst I have encountered have been overwhelming. I'm at a stage now where I genuinely feel like this could be the right job for me - I have excellent communication and interpersonal skills, I enjoy and am skilled as critical analysis and problem solving, and have found myself to easily understand and perform statistics and statistical analysis. I just don't know where to start!

I understand 'data analyst' is an extremely broad term, but I know I want to get my foot in the door and begin learning. In Australia, there appears to be a huge volume of demand for data analysts with little supply. As such, more masters degrees have come about in the field. Currently, the degree I am looking at is a Master of Analytics in the business faculty of one of the largest universities here. The degree involves learning programming (to a lesser extent than data science), ethics, foundations of analysis, visual representation of data etc etc. 

Here is my question - will completing a masters degree of this sort, while also expanding my own knowledge of programming/statistics etc in my own time, be a meaningful way to begin my career? 

My concerns include: 

\- While I am good at statistics, I have always struggled with maths 

\- Being a female, am I less likely to be taken seriously in the industry? 

\- Would a master of statistics/mathematics be significantly more useful than a master of analytics or data science? 

Completing a masters degree in the field is something I would really love to do, but I don't want to be wasting my time if it will have no real benefit.

I work as an analyst in a tech department and every week we have a team meeting that is lead by a different person each week. It's my turn this week and I am asking for some inspiration on good analytics topics to hold a 30-minute discussion/debate.

Some more context:

\- Not all of us work with data, so a discussion on a really advanced, niche concept won't be suitable for everyone (unless it's high level like the applications of ML)

\- There are approximately 8 of us and the more interactive sessions tend to work better.

\- It has to be delivered remotely

\- No COVID-related topics.

Some recent sessions have been:

\- Discussion on data privacy (ethics, technologies, consequences)

\- AWS (each person chose an AWS they liked and gave a mini-presentation on it)

\- Discussion on digital identity

I'm posting here to really seek for some help or advice in terms of web analytics. I recently landed a role as a data analyst for a web-related company. For anonymity purposes, I'll leave the company name out. It's a fairly small/medium-sized company, so unfortunately, due to some circumstances, when I joined the company, I became the only data analyst. However, I'm actually really really junior and I consider myself quite lucky to have gotten the role. I am also fairly new to the field, well, very new. And have limited domain knowledge. 

I'm writing here because I want to know if there's anyone on this sub that could provide me some resources/tools/tips/anything for me learn in regards to web analytics. Or perhaps be willing to connect with me and teach me a thing or two. 

At my current 'level', I'm able to somewhat be on the 'reporting' side of data. However, I want to (and need to) be able to improve myself to be able to generate 'insights' and stories from the insights. Some examples of things that I would love to know are:

* Are there any must-have visualizations that I should create to monitor specific metrics?
* How do I create 'pre-post analysis'?
* What should I look at if I want to see changes in 'shopper behavior'? I know there's a multitude of possibilities, but it would be nice to have some examples of where I can start to look at this.

r/analytics,"Hi,

Hopefully I’m in the right place with this question :)

We have multiple campaigns running on different social channels at once. I’d like a way to group social post performance (e.g. engagement, impressions, etc.) and then report on these. So for example if we were running a campaign on a specific software, I’d be able to report on social posts that were just related to this campaign.

I’m a bit unsure how I can achieve this segregation by campaign when it comes to social performance. Does anyone have experience with this?

I want to ultimately report using Data Studio. Looking at Supermetrics for API connection, but doesn’t really solve my problem of being able to group social post performance by campaign. Even if I can use a data vis option, any option would be good!

B2B so this is mostly LinkedIn data btw, which might be limited via APIs anyway.

Any help would be appreciated. Many thanks in advance!",t2_44pgqfh7,Social Analytics by Campaign,,t3_g1otvl,1.0,4,Question,4,1586972360.0,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hopefully I’m in the right place with this question :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have multiple campaigns running on different social channels at once. I’d like a way to group social post performance (e.g. engagement, impressions, etc.) and then report on these. So for example if we were running a campaign on a specific software, I’d be able to report on social posts that were just related to this campaign.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m a bit unsure how I can achieve this segregation by campaign when it comes to social performance. Does anyone have experience with this?&lt;/p&gt;

**Question** : Prepare a mathematical model to determine order of post for each user. Please create a database of 10k rows with random data for users.

Objective :To show users most relevant posts at the top, basis his past interaction with the app.

Relevant post : The post he is most likely to interact with.

Step 1 : Determine input variables like upvote, downvote, time spent on post, etc.(Use the app to find out more input variables) by a user for every post

Step 1 is an important step which will determine how well your model wpuld work

Step 2 : Populate these variables with random data for each of the user

Step 3 : Based on your analysis of the data, create a mathematical formula to rank each post (Top ranked most will be shown to the user at first )

We will test your model, by entering values for the input variables for a post and checking the rank it outputs. Please state the what weightage you are assigning to each factor and why?

You can assume details, if any, that is missing in this task. Just state your assumptions in your submission.

Format : Please upload your excel with marked cells where we can enter values for input variables, and then it should output a rank in another cell. You can state your assumptions and reasons in the excel itself, on a different sheet

&lt;p&gt;Step 1 : Determine input variables like upvote, downvote, time spent on post, etc.(Use the app to find out more input variables) by a user for every post&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Step 1 is an important step which will determine how well your model wpuld work&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Step 2 : Populate these variables with random data for each of the user&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Step 3 : Based on your analysis of the data, create a mathematical formula to rank each post (Top ranked most will be shown to the user at first )&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will test your model, by entering values for the input variables for a post and checking the rank it outputs. Please state the what weightage you are assigning to each factor and why?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can assume details, if any, that is missing in this task. Just state your assumptions in your submission.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Format : Please upload your excel with marked cells where we can enter values for input variables, and then it should output a rank in another cell. You can state your assumptions and reasons in the excel itself, on a different sheet&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

I've been using Tableau for a few years now and I haven't been successful in creating reports mixing multiple data sources.

The problem here is when you do bring in multiple separate data sources, how can you display different fields in a table view. (Let's assume the data models and sources are set up correctly).These are two completely different sources and quite large, so it is not ideal to bring them in together as one data source.

I know Tableau has data blending but the thing is if a source uses different filters than the other source, how can i display fields from the second source cleanly without affecting the first source. I've been successful at times using a mix of LODs and different filters but it's not always effective.

Having that said (this isn't a tableau question), but my company has been trying out different BI tools such as Looker, SiSense, etc. and with their POCs, I haven't had any luck figuring if there's a clean way in showing data (tabular view) with multiple sources.

r/analytics,"Brooks Bell has been hosting weekly virtual roundtables with enterprise testing leaders across many different industries. Here are some of the more interesting takeaways from these conversations:

* Be intentional about what you want to learn about your customers during this time.
* Remember that running tests during a crisis doesn’t necessarily negate the results.
* If you *have* to launch a new product, feature or campaign without doing any testing, consider launching it to 95% of users and use the remaining 5% as a holdout group.
* Time is of the essence. We’re seeing a combination of tactics being used to speed up iteration: testing micro-step conversions, using holdout groups, planning for backtests or simply launching with a pre- and post-analysis. 
* Use data from your CDP to look at your website behavior in the context of demographic or location-based data.
* If your company has typically relied on an in-person experience to drive sales, you may have to do more work to educate your website visitors now that digital is the only option.
* Keep moving ahead with cautious optimism: If a test has already started, keep it running. Evaluate others on a case by case basis, and plan for multiple versions of the future - particularly as it relates to Q4 / peak season.

A week ago I set up a campaign in Ads and started noticing that there are apparently &amp;quot;0&amp;quot; conversions [set up on account level with source Analytics]. I checked Hubspot and found that there have been 3 new contacts created via paid search. This led me to check Google Analytics (which I honestly don&amp;#39;t use regularly). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I figured is this: Conversion Goals set up, as page visits (both events &amp;amp; destination) &amp;amp; PPC phone call, by an agency before me (all checked Recording = On and I&amp;#39;ve not touched anything after the handover) suddenly stopped recording conversion goals on Jan 24th. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have researched some stuff online and re-installed some tags - using the Google tag manager and copy-pasted in Site &amp;lt;header&amp;gt;  HTML (in Hubspot settings) 3 days ago. I have no coding background and I did the best I could reading Google&amp;#39;s instructions. It is still not working - I have visited the &amp;quot;destination&amp;quot; URLs that GA is supposed be tracking but nothing shows up in the goal tracking graph.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am not exaggerating when I am saying that I am losing sleep over this. I have a lot riding on this campaign and if I can&amp;#39;t prove that it is getting any conversions  - then really whats the point :( Please help!!!! I don&amp;#39;t want to be more frustrated than I have to be sitting home all day in this lockdown! Thanks in advance.&lt;/p&gt;

r/analytics,"**Overview:**

So the data is from a lending company who's main product provides loans to emerging markets, and the customer base consists of individuals who use the product regularly to grow their business, while others use it for more on demand purposes. My goal is to create and define a new metric called ""Active Customers"". I am performing my analysis using RStudio.

**Some of the deliverables that I want to pursue include:** 

\- Defining what an active customer is, and the cutoff threshold for how long they should be considered an active customer.

\- Summarize ""Customer Retention Rates"" based on the newly defined Active Customer definition. 

**Data:**

All the data is customer loan history from customers who signed up in Q1 of 2017. I've already performed the data cleansing and have a little over 1.3 million observations and reduced my dataset to 10 variables. Each row of data represents a loan application and their are some customers with multiple applications. Some of my left over variables are: 

\- Date of application

\- Approval decision of application

\- Disbursement date

\- Loan amount disbursed

\- Number of repayments made

\- Due date

\- Loan outstanding

So, how do I go about defining what an active customer is using the information above? Should I perform some kind of analysis or just make a general assumption/definition based on general business standards. I personally think that If a customer has applied for more than one loan and/or currently has a loan outstanding, then they are considered an ""Active Customer""; and, if the customer has no outstanding loans or has only one application that was reject then they are not considered ""Active"". How should I go about defining the ""Active Customer"" metric with the sample data listed above.",t2_y162550,"Hey everyone, I'm working on a project and could use some help getting started...",,t3_fjabbo,0.8,8,,8,1584341788.0,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Overview:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Data:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All the data is customer loan history from customers who signed up in Q1 of 2017. I&amp;#39;ve already performed the data cleansing and have a little over 1.3 million observations and reduced my dataset to 10 variables. Each row of data represents a loan application and their are some customers with multiple applications. Some of my left over variables are: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- Date of application&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- Approval decision of application&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- Disbursement date&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- Loan amount disbursed&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- Number of repayments made&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- Due date&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- Loan outstanding&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, how do I go about defining what an active customer is using the information above? Should I perform some kind of analysis or just make a general assumption/definition based on general business standards. I personally think that If a customer has applied for more than one loan and/or currently has a loan outstanding, then they are considered an &amp;quot;Active Customer&amp;quot;; and, if the customer has no outstanding loans or has only one application that was reject then they are not considered &amp;quot;Active&amp;quot;. How should I go about defining the &amp;quot;Active Customer&amp;quot; metric with the sample data listed above.&lt;/p&gt;

r/analytics,"Hi there,

I'm not very proficient with GA yet (we mainly use other toolsets), but I recall when GA was first becoming a thing, there were a lot of discussions regarding how if you're not paying for what is today called 360, Google would take samples of your data to use for their own purposes, marketing or otherwise. Is this still true to this day? Is that the cost of doing business if you use GA but don't pay for 360?

There are all these lovely EULAs and whatnot, but as usual they're about as impenetrable as a bank vault to the layman. I understand they don't collect identifiable information (email, names, etc.), but to what extent can I really call my data ""secure"" if I use GA? Can I, with a straight face, tell my clients that only I have access to the data we collect, or is that a lie if I use GA?

Any and all help with understanding this further would be greatly appreciated!

r/analytics,"Hi there,

&amp;#x200B;

I want to clarify the **process of how a dataLayer works with GTM**. As we're going to be dataLayer event driven going forwards. Could someone  kindly give me some pointers whether the below is correct or not please:

&amp;#x200B;

1) developer creates the keys value pairs in the abstract model repository that lives in the backend of a page, and these keys and values are based on the analytics requirement i.e. data mapping 

&amp;#x200B;

2) once these values and keys are populated for the necessary page (s), a dataLayer.  push script is written and added below the GTM container tag on the page. For example:

 

window.dataLayer = window.dataLayer || \[\];

window.dataLayer.push({

  event: ""gaEvent"",

  eventCategory: ""{eventCategory}"",

  eventAction: ""{eventAction}"",

  eventLabel: ""{eventLabel}"",

  eventValue: ""{eventValue}""

});

&amp;#x200B;

3) These events keys and values are surfaced through GTM from a dataLayer variable or JS variable 

&amp;#x200B;

4) These can then be used in tags and triggers 

&amp;#x200B;

Is this the way a conventional dataLayer works? So, are the steps above correct or am I missing anything? What i dont understand is, if i was to add scroll tracking based on the above configuration i'll need to add them as DLV then use it in my tags to create the scroll tracking?

r/analytics,"Background:

I have a BS in Statistics and I know how to use the common tools (Excel, SQL, Python, R, etc) but no working experience in Analytics. Since graduating college I was working in education (teaching math), with the idea of eventually transitioning into data analysis (and even more eventually, data science).

Current situation:

After sending out a lot of online applications, I finally got hired as an Analyst! I work at an ad agency and I started two weeks ago. The job is above the salary I was looking for, the benefits are great, and the work environment is great.

However, I’m not doing any data analysis.

Before I got hired, I could tell from the job description that the role wasn’t as analytical as some other roles I was looking at, as most of the description was devoted to managing projects. But another part of the description mentioned that I would be aggregating data and presenting reports, plus they said they would prefer Business/Math/Stats majors and proficiency in Excel. I still decided to apply, figuring it would be a good entry-level transition into Analytics, even if I was just using Excel.

During the interview they did the usual review of my prior experience. They specifically asked if I could create Excel macros and use VBA, and seemed excited that I had those skills.

On my first day, while going through orientation with IT, the IT guy mentioned that Analysts should download Python and SQL Server to their laptops. I was surprised, since thus far I expected I would be using Excel, but excited that I would be able to use more advanced tools on the job.

During training I learned the in-house and third-party tools the company uses for their workflow, but nothing to do with data analysis. I knew that project management was part of my job description, so I figured the analysis part of my training would come a bit later. After a week of training, I finally asked my supervisor when I would start doing data analysis, and he clarified that at that company they use the term Analyst for entry-level positions. For instance, if you were in the Planning department your roles would be Analyst, Planning; Supervisor, Planning; Director, Planning. An actual data analyst would be in the Analytics department (eg, Analyst, Analytics). It finally dawned on me that I had not been hired to do any data analysis.

I wasn’t the only one who was confused. I spoke to the other Analysts that were hired around the same time as me, and they were also wondering when they would be analyzing data.

I’m a bit disappointed, obviously. But I’m not in a position to quit this job, nor do I want to. I was financially unstable before, frequently dipping into my dwindling savings, and this new job has given me a lot of security.

Since I’m not planning to quit this job, what can I do to make the most it and gain experience for a future Data Analyst role? Luckily my current job isn’t completely divorced from data—in fact a large bulk of it has to do with data governance, so hopefully I can connect that to data analysis somehow. Also I may still be making reports, though in a very limited fashion. Plus I have the opportunity to gain a lot of valuable domain knowledge for the advertising industry.

What I’m doing right now:

-Using my free time at work and at home to develop my skills in SQL, Excel, etc.

-Attending local Data Science meetings to learn and meet people. Just recently I met someone who said he’d be happy to put in a good word for me at his job, so I’m holding onto that lead.

What I’m planning to do:

-Introduce myself to the Analytics team and ask about their work (I’m shy so this is surprisingly hard lol. Luckily they sit right behind me)

-Ask my boss if I can devote some of my free time at work to helping the Analytics team. I’m planning to wait until I’ve been here longer before making this possibly odd request.

Luckily my current job isn’t completely divorced from data—in fact a large bulk of it has to do with data governance, so hopefully I can connect that to data analysis somehow. Also I may still be making reports, though in a very limited fashion. Plus I have the opportunity to gain a lot of valuable domain knowledge for the advertising industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I’m doing right now:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-Using my free time at work and at home to develop my skills in SQL, Excel, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-Attending local Data Science meetings to learn and meet people. Just recently I met someone who said he’d be happy to put in a good word for me at his job, so I’m holding onto that lead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I’m planning to do:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-Introduce myself to the Analytics team and ask about their work (I’m shy so this is surprisingly hard lol. Luckily they sit right behind me)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-Ask my boss if I can devote some of my free time at work to helping the Analytics team. I’m planning to wait until I’ve been here longer before making this possibly odd request.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TLDR; I unknowingly got hired as an Analyst who doesn&amp;#39;t actually do any data analysis. Looking for advice on how to make the best of this situation.&lt;/p&gt;

r/analytics,"Hello,

I'm looking into graduate programs and before I make my decision, there's one thing I want to straighten out.

Given that MIT Sloan, the top-ranked Master of Business Analytics program refers to itself as an MBAN, I have to figure that this is not an issue that should deter me from the MBAN program that I am looking at.

We must be able to tie every session ID to a marketing channel all the way to the level of particular tracking IDs such as Google glid, or CJ&amp;#39;s cjevent.  Our current Adobe setup is excellent, so we can&amp;#39;t lose quality in a possible vendor switch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additional details:  We have two ecommerce sites.  Combined they get about 140 million page views per year.  We&amp;#39;re growing, so I would plan for at least 180 million page views in the next 12 months.

Hello!

I posted in r/SQL but did not receive many responses, so I wanted to see if y'all in this sub could help a fella out!

I currently work on a Data Warehousing team and have a significant understanding in joining data, subquerying, case statements, applying business logic, etc. I am more looking to get into the side of using these tables to do further analysis to impact business decision making / optimization. 

I would like to learn more about how to utilize SQL to do operational analysis (particularly focused on customer service and optimization - think a team trying to close customer tickets, etc.). I do not know much about using date functions, and trending data over time in SQL and am looking for a place to learn more about this. Particularly what I am looking for is to answer questions like ""What is our average rate of ticket closure compared to daily levels?"" ""Have we been able to become more effective on resolving tickets, and reduced the time it takes to close tickets over time?"" ""What's the average first touch point to a ticket?"" Etc.

I have taken a look at Datacamp's exploratory analysis online learning, which was helpful, but I would like to continue delve into this area to further firm out my understanding. Are there any places to learn how to better structure queries / use SQL to do this type of analysis that you've found successful? I would like to continue to practice and have limited access to this type of data to do so. Any ideas would be helpful! I.E. how to get access to this type of data to practice, online learning, books, etc.

Any type of SQL is fine. Also, if this is not the place to post this, then please let me know where else I should do so!

Thanks for your help!

r/analytics,"Hey all,

I am in the process of configuring my new real estate sites GTM and confused on the optimal AW+GA conversion tracking configuration.

* I have Goals created in GA and linked my AW and GA accounts. Additionally, I also have the standard GA (All pageview trigger) tag applied to my GTM.

My question is since I have my GA and AW accounts linked, do I also need to set up the AW conversion tag?

When I think about it is seems unnecessary, redundant, or could possibly inflate my metrics by double-counting leads - Am I assuming correctly that considering my goals are created in GA and my account is linked that the appropriate information is being captured?

Here is where I get really confused:

We use a platform called Sierra Interactive and they have a backend console (like most platforms) that allows us to enter our GA tracking code, Ad words conversion ID and Label, FB Pixel, etc.

My concern is that if I remove the AW Conversion code from the console and don't set up the conversion tracking code in GTM the system will not correctly tag incoming leads, even though I am appropriately linked via GA.

I am learning as I go, so I am not looking to do anything complex. The goal is to capture all the data from all of our lead sources and have them appropriately tagged in the system using GTM. I found that simply by entering the tracking codes, and IDs were limiting.

r/analytics,"So I want to start off by saying I've been going through Google email, phone, and chat support for almost 2 months now.

ABC - Company my agency represents

CUNT - Their old IM agency

US - my agency

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Here's whats going on:

My agency manages client ABC. We handle their SEO, Internet Marketing, and Web Design. ABC used to use CUNT for their SEO and Marketing. CUNT was an awful agency and didn't show any progress or improvements, so they fired CUNT and hired us.

CUNT created an analytics account for ABC. ABC never had access to it as they delegated all work to CUNT. 

We took over ABC. I went to gain analytics access from CUNT, but he never responded to requests over the phone or email. On the phone, CUNT told me verbatim ""I have no access to that account anymore so I can't help you"". Ok, fine. So I contacted Google Support.

They had me prove authority to access the site. I did this by adding an analytics.txt to the domain as well as editing the Home page meta-description to show we have access to the back-end of the website as well.

I'm not quite sure what this process was for, since all Google had to do was send an email to CUNT asking CUNT to give US access to the account.

They did that and CUNT granted us access. However, CUNT only gave us read permissions. We need full ownership for obvious reasons. CUNT has absolutely nothing to do with ABC anymore. 

So I try to contact CUNT again and ask that he approves my management requests sent through email. He never approves these requests or responds to my separate emails. I go back and tell Google this, but all they will do is continue to send CUNT emails requesting ownership for US. This never works out because CUNT never approves the email.

So I get fed up and call CUNT today, and man was CUNT a cunt. He answers, I say ""Hello, this is John Doe with US, I had some questions about the analytics account for ABC if you had a minute or two?"".

CUNT says ""What do you want?""

I say ""Well we need ownership of ABC analytics so we can do with it what we need. You've giv----""

CUNT cut me off.

CUNT: ""I already worked with someone over there and got this taken care of.""

Me: ""Yes CUNT, that was me. Unfortunately we only got read access so we need ownershi---""

CUNT: ""I'M VERY BUSY.""

Me: ""Understandable. I simply need you to approve this request. You still use the email cunt@CUNT.com?""

CUNT: ""I haven't gotten any emails. I'M VERY BUSY!""

Me: ""Again, I understand. I'm sending another request right now if you could quickly check it while I'm on the phone with you?""

CUNT: ""Look, I am VERY BUSY. I don't have time for this.""

*Hangs up*

It's apparent that he has no interest in helping out and will never transfer the property to me. I've basically spammed him with management/ownership request emails at this point, and so had Google Support. I don't want to piss him off more though if he decides to delete ALL the data. 

I'm working on just downloading all the data separately and removing his tracking code and adding my own. This is my last resort though as we use tons of reporting softwares that require past analytics data.

I'm currently on hold with Google Support chat and have been for about 2 hours.

Does ANYBODY have any insights as to how I can get this fucking property? It's setting us back with ABC and I understand that CUNT is mad that his agency is so shit that they can't hold a simple client.

What can I do? Should I just download the data and start from scratch with a new account?

ABC even tried helping at one point by contacting CUNT, but that didn't work.

I have a conundrum that I feel like I'm very close to solving but I just need help getting over the line.

I recently had an interview for an internship for an analytics position. They asked me a couple questions but I couldn't answer this one

Here it is

We have something called an attractiveness quotient that goes from 0 to 1.

1. Eye color - has 4 categories ( blue, brown, hazel, green)

2. Hair color - has 3 categories (blonde, black, brunette)

3. Weight 
4. Height 

Now the question was to find the correlation of all these variables to attractiveness quotient. He gave me a hint that the magnitude by which each of these variables affects the attractiveness quotient will be different obviously. And he said the answer is purely based on statistics and no machine learning or anything.

I only know Pearson's coefficient in correlation but I am very sure that won't help here :(

r/analytics,"  

hello,

I graduated with an accounting degree, was an accountant for 1 year and I am not a rly good accountant but after 1 year my boss suggested. me I apply to a new department that was forming up which is FP&amp;A (financial planning and analysis)

The reason he told me to apply was because I was good with power query, I knew how data flowed and was organized in the company and knew how to make relationship in power pivot and very basic DAX formula.

I need to mention all the data of the organisation are in a visual studio SSAS cube (same as power pivot but centralized when deployed)

Now my old boss was fire 2month after my promotion and he was the guy who built all the cube all table and linked and DAX and calculated column (pretty fucking advanced)

Now I've been 1year in the FP&amp;A position and I just got a bad review from my new boss (2/5). 2 main point of the review was, I was too much helping other department with the cube and wasn't focus enough on FP&amp;A, she told me some day I was 60% not at my desk because I was helping others. second point was that I sent some file without making enough validation before sending so there was some mistakes in it (as I said I am not the best accountant and honestly I do not have a lot of time to validate myself as I feel I am doing 4 jobs at the same time (FP&amp;A, Data modeler, IT Support, helping my old department in accounting as they are overwhelmed)

And it is true, but I am now the only person who has access and understand the cube in a 150ppl office. so yes, I often get calls from like the fiscality director saying he did a pivot table but numbers do not make sense, so I need to show up look at his slicers and realized he used the wrong measure or filter and help him out...Or I get a call from acocunting saying the new Accounting account she made in the accounting software doesn't show up in the pivot table and then I realized she didn't use an account from the master chart of account (my table in my model) so the account was showing in an empty row because it wasn't mapped, etc., etc., etc.

So at the end of the review we agreed I would let my senior (between me and my boss) know everytime I went to help an other department.

It has been a month since the review and I did let me senior know every single time I went to help, but everytime she told me it is fine to go after I tried to explained to her what the problem was or how critical it was. (So did I get a bad review for nothing? I do the exact samething as before the only difference is that I waste more time explaining it to my senior).

Anyway, I am writing this because I got a big demand from accounting this week so I told my senior it would take me 2-3days to implement, so she told my boss if it was okay, she said no you do not have time to waste 3 days on this, we are in year end and I need an analyst. So I had to see her because well this project is vital, accounting won't be able to be in compliance with the auditor without this project if it is not competed before FEB 27 (i did not told her that, because I thought she knew, but maybe she didn't, anyway) she agreed to let me work 2hours on the project but if it was more to just stop.

Of course it wasn't going to take 2 hours but I knew accounting needed it.... so what am I supposed to do? I told my senior this Friday before leaving that I would complete it during the weekend on my own time (like I have a choice...). and she replied if I would be able to show the DBA next week what I would have done, so I wouldn't have to deal with those thing in the future and be an analyst. I replied well it is not the DBA job to do the data modelisation (and I already spoke to the DBA prior to that and he agrees too, he is not an accountant and he doesn't know DAX, etc) and I saw on her face she just didn't understand and was a bit frustrated I wouldn't show the DBA (because for her it would solve the problem of me not having time to be an analyst)

I spoke to the IT director about that and he told me he wouldn't hire a full time Data scientist/Data modeler as we will probably change to an ERP software and it might replace the cube.

So now I am frustrated because I work and study BI and DAX and relationship model like crazy as I get stressed out something will crash anyday and I am the only one who understand what I do and how the data circulate in the organization. I just got told that everything I am studying might not exists in 2years anymore by the IT director. I got a bad review because I got too many responsibilities?!? I was also going to that interview expecting a stellar review and a big pay raise for all the stuff I do and the responsibilities I took... but I just think no one understands what I do....they just see me not performing as an analyst...and now I need to work pro bono during weekend to accomplish all my responsibilities without defying my boss max of 2 hours on this project...

I know I am a very bad communicator and I hate confrontation....I also just bought a house and I an now financially dependent on that job...I was kinda in shock during review so I just noded at everything when she was telling me why I got 2/5...maybe I should had try to confront my boss telling her it was a critical project and I needed to do it even if it was more than 2 hours.... but instead I just didn't confront her and I am doing it during my weekend...

anyway not sure what I expect from you guys.... but I do not thing it is sustainable to have that much anxiety about my future (ERP coming) and feeling guilty of helping other department when I know by boss doesn't like it... and feeling stress that the cube my old boss put in place, it is very advanced, and I am still pretty new to all this BI stuff, so I do not fully understands it either...I am also stress I might get fired by my boss since now I know she is unhappy with my performance...

anyway what would you guys do in my situation?

Ultimately I would love to keep studying BI and have a career in BI (as I really like this, a lot more than accounting/FP&amp;A) but I do not feel I know enough to switch job to a BI job.",t2_1itbsw4e,Career/Job Advice (from FP&amp;A to BI),,t3_f7sujk,0.67,1,,1,1582408754.0,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;hello,&lt;/p&gt;

(So did I get a bad review for nothing? I do the exact samething as before the only difference is that I waste more time explaining it to my senior).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I am writing this because I got a big demand from accounting this week so I told my senior it would take me 2-3days to implement, so she told my boss if it was okay, she said no you do not have time to waste 3 days on this, we are in year end and I need an analyst. So I had to see her because well this project is vital, accounting won&amp;#39;t be able to be in compliance with the auditor without this project if it is not competed before FEB 27 (i did not told her that, because I thought she knew, but maybe she didn&amp;#39;t, anyway) she agreed to let me work 2hours on the project but if it was more to just stop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course it wasn&amp;#39;t going to take 2 hours but I knew accounting needed it.... so what am I supposed to do? I told my senior this Friday before leaving that I would complete it during the weekend on my own time (like I have a choice...). and she replied if I would be able to show the DBA next week what I would have done, so I wouldn&amp;#39;t have to deal with those thing in the future and be an analyst. I replied well it is not the DBA job to do the data modelisation (and I already spoke to the DBA prior to that and he agrees too, he is not an accountant and he doesn&amp;#39;t know DAX, etc) and I saw on her face she just didn&amp;#39;t understand and was a bit frustrated I wouldn&amp;#39;t show the DBA (because for her it would solve the problem of me not having time to be an analyst)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I spoke to the IT director about that and he told me he wouldn&amp;#39;t hire a full time Data scientist/Data modeler as we will probably change to an ERP software and it might replace the cube.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So now I am frustrated because I work and study BI and DAX and relationship model like crazy as I get stressed out something will crash anyday and I am the only one who understand what I do and how the data circulate in the organization. I just got told that everything I am studying might not exists in 2years anymore by the IT director. I got a bad review because I got too many responsibilities?!? I was also going to that interview expecting a stellar review and a big pay raise for all the stuff I do and the responsibilities I took... but I just think no one understands what I do....they just see me not performing as an analyst...and now I need to work pro bono during weekend to accomplish all my responsibilities without defying my boss max of 2 hours on this project...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know I am a very bad communicator and I hate confrontation....I also just bought a house and I an now financially dependent on that job...I was kinda in shock during review so I just noded at everything when she was telling me why I got 2/5...maybe I should had try to confront my boss telling her it was a critical project and I needed to do it even if it was more than 2 hours.... but instead I just didn&amp;#39;t confront her and I am doing it during my weekend...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;anyway not sure what I expect from you guys.... but I do not thing it is sustainable to have that much anxiety about my future (ERP coming) and feeling guilty of helping other department when I know by boss doesn&amp;#39;t like it... and feeling stress that the cube my old boss put in place, it is very advanced, and I am still pretty new to all this BI stuff, so I do not fully understands it either...I am also stress I might get fired by my boss since now I know she is unhappy with my performance...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;anyway what would you guys do in my situation?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately I would love to keep studying BI and have a career in BI (as I really like this, a lot more than accounting/FP&amp;amp;A) but I do not feel I know enough to switch job to a BI job.&lt;/p&gt;

Basically, she works at a trucking company, and she started as a receptionist years ago but was just... Slowly given more duties. First it was payroll. Then it was managing all of the dispatchers.

They've given her all of these responsibilities, and have literally made a new position title for her, but she's received maybe *one* raise.

&lt;p&gt;As the title says, I&amp;#39;m trying to set a user id for each user. The tag type is a Google Analaytics: App + Web Configuration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Googling it or even checking Google&amp;#39;s own documentation yields different results and the problem is, I can&amp;#39;t see the affect of any of my changes in Google Analytics for around 24 hours which isn&amp;#39;t ideal. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Getting the value from the datalayer into google tag manager isn&amp;#39;t an issue, that is all working 100% correctly according to the preview mode.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So for the fields to set, is it one of the following? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;userId
user_id
user_Id
userID
&amp;amp;uid

I'm a CPA whose work experience, unsurprisingly, has been in financial reporting and analysis. I've always been a data geek and making decisions based on the stats presented as well as developing reports/dashboards/charts to monitor and assess the health of the business. 

I believe finance/accounting is moving toward this data-centric model and wanted to know what tools you recommend I learn to become more data-savvy as a finance professional and speak the same language as the IT/analytics departments at companies. 

Correct me if I'm wrong, but I think going really in-depth on languages like Python/R might be overkill at the manager+ level in finance, even if big data completely takes over. SQL seems to be useful because it'll allow me to mine for data myself versus relying on IT. Tableau/PowerBI seem useful because I'll be able to present dashboards/charts that executives/finance professionals need to make decisions about profitability, etc. Is there anything else you've seen finance departments use, however, to make data collection and aggregation more efficient?

r/analytics,"So a brief description of my issue:

I'm part of a graphic design team for a company. Recently my supervisor has been trying to research a way to collect data from our fillable forms for design requests. She wants to specifically be able to extract data about how many departments we service, how often we service specific departments, and the type of service we provide them (what kind of design, etc). To show to the higher ups in a more analytical format since our dept. is always on the chopping block despite all the work we do.

Excel goes over my head, but things are slow atm so I'm trying to help her out, but I'm lost with most of this. I've found out how to convert a pdf of our request form into excel but I don't know how to extract that into easy to summarize data for the above. I figure we need to add specific categories to the form to make this easier but I'm just trying to get an easy to describe solution to this issue.

I'm currently a data analyst for an organization and have been acting in the role for almost 2 years. The large portion of my role is dominated by report creation and modification inside of Oracle CX, as well as Sales analytics and statistics.

Currently, I have no formal qualifications outside of the completion of high school and a very small course in excel.

I'd consider my excel knowledge OK, I have working knowledge of functions such as VLOOKUP's and other somewhat advanced functions, however I have no knowledge of VBA.

I have a working knowledge of Oracle SQL, however again, this isn't too advanced. I can create some complex expressions but nothing too fancy, and I have no knowledge of script creation.
I am also branching out into data visualization through PowerBI. Making attractive and insightful visualizations is something I enjoy and take pride in.

I am seeking advice as to what areas (Programs/Languages) I should focus on, as well as what kind of formal qualifications I should pursue. I don't plan to take any time away from work to pursue full time study, however, there are many online part time programs through reputable universities in my country. I'm currently looking at a Graduate Certificate/Diploma of Data Analytics which could be completed in around a year part time, exclusively online.

I was recently accepted into my university’s MS in Business Analytics program. It’s a 16 month program that would cost between $40-50k once all is said and done with tuition and housing. I’m ecstatic to have been accepted, however I am not totally sold on the program just yet.

In my mind, there are two options: the first is to join the MS program, get 16 months of experience using tools and softwares relevant to my future career, work with industry professionals, and really hone my abilities in data analytics.

The second option would be to join the workforce and try to get a job in Marketing (my undergrad degree), and on my own initiative, practice data skills within my position in an attempt to move up/change roles either within the company or find a different job after having that chance to showcase my interest in a data-focused role.

If anyone has any experience transitioning from a non-data role to a data role without a Master’s degree, or if anyone found that a MS program really propelled their career, I would love to hear your input and am all ears. Thank you in advance.

r/analytics,"When conducting experiments, teams usually include all the active users in their tests, or sometimes they tend to add all the new users who join the app during this test. So when calculating the metrics for different test groups, all the data from the moment the A/B test kicks off is taken into account.

Today I’ll talk about how you can reduce the time required to get the signal on the change you are testing in a product. You can do that by changing the process of adding users to the A/B test, and in this essay I will show you how you can do it.

## Two approaches towards designing an A / B test

Let’s start with an example.

You’ve noticed that some app users abandon their purchase during checkout. The hypothesis is that with the help of a series of push notifications (reminders, testimonials from other customers, payment plans, etc.), we can convince some of the churned users to complete the purchase, which will have a positive impact on the app monetization.

The standard way to test a hypothesis using an A/B test is as follows:

1. Add all the active users to the A/B test and randomly split them into two groups (test and control).
2. In the test group, enable the push-notification logic we talked about earlier. The control group’s experience remains the same as before.
3. Measure the impact on the key metrics by comparing the performance of the two groups.

Here is the recommended way to validate a hypothesis using an A/B test:

1. Make sure to add users to the A/B test only at the point where we are going to change their experience in the product, i.e. send a push notification from the tested campaign for the first time.
2. Send a series of push notifications to the users from the test group; don’t send any notifications to the users from the control group.
3. Measure the impact on the key metrics by comparing the performance of the two groups.

The recommended experiment design involves two changes:

1. Make sure to add only those users to the test group who could experience the change in the product (we say “could” since we change the experience only for 50% of these users who will be randomly assigned to the test group).
2. When analyzing the results of the test, make sure to look at the data for these users only from the moment we added them to the test, and not from the moment we started the experiment.

An experiment designed according to these rules will require significantly less time to identify the effect of the change, if any. Let’s find out why.

## Make sure to add to your A/B test only those users who could feel the difference while using the product

Say you started an A/B test on April 1 and finished it on April 30.

The target metric in the experiment is the purchase conversion rate (the proportion of users in the groups who made a purchase).

* Purchase conversion rate in the control group will be 4.4% (4,000 + 400 / 100,000).
* Purchase conversion rate in the test group it will be 4.5% (4,000 + 500 / 100,000).
* There is no statistically significant difference. P-value = 28%. This means that there is a high probability that the observed change is accidental.

Now imagine that we added to the experiment only those who could get some new experience while using the product. And those are the users who abandoned their shopping cart while making a purchase.

Let’s calculate how changing the way of adding users to the test affected the conversion rate:

* Purchase conversion for users who have become part of the experiment will be 6.6% (400 / 6,000) in the control group and 8.3% (500 / 6,000) in the test group.
* This difference is statistically significant; even a smaller sample would have been enough to spot the effect of the change made.

When you populate the experiment with users whose experience is not different in test and control groups, you create noise in the data. It makes it harder to notice the signal that comes from users who have experienced the change we made. If the key metric is greatly influenced by the users with a similar experience, then it will take you much longer to identify the effect.

To draw an analogy, think of testing a drug. Let’s assume that for some reason, we add to the experiment not only people with the disease the drug is supposed to cure, but also people who are healthy. If we compare the proportion of healthy people in each of the groups after applying the drug, then healthy people will blur the drug effectiveness metrics intended to be tested on people who are sick.

In the example with the abandoned purchases, the users who immediately made the purchase will have a more significant impact on the test results than those who abandoned their purchase. At the same time, the changes we are testing have no influence on the users who made a purchase right away. Adding these users to the test will blur the effect that the changes will have on the real target of the test (the users who abandoned the purchase). As a result, it will take us much longer to observe the effect of the change we’ve made.

One technical issue is worth noting here. You can add all the users you have to the A/B test, and then analyze only those who could have experienced something new in the product. You can do that, but in most cases it will require some manual work afterwards. If you somehow automate the analyzing part of your test, it is better to only include users who will have a new experience.

## Use data only from the moment when users were added to the test

There is another way to blur the effect of the change you are testing. It happens when you take into account all the data from the moment when A/B test starts. To avoid this effect, you should only add data from the moment when each specific user becomes part of your test.

Most users spot something new in the product not at the moment when you start the test, but a bit later. You add extra noise to your data if you consider the time between starting the test and the moment the user becomes a part of it.

Here’s an example: You started the A/B test on April 1st. User X abandoned the purchase on April 10 and at this moment became a part of your experiment. It will be correct to consider data for this user only from April 10 when you will be calculating the metrics. The data obtained between April 1 and 10 doesn’t demonstrate the influence of the tested change on this user because her experience didn’t change during this period.

*In the example above, adding such data will not affect the conversion to purchase rate, but it may well affect other metrics.*

## How to understand the overall effect of a change made

The described approach of adding users to experiments reduces the time required to identify the possible effect of the changes made to your product. However, it slightly complicates the interpretation of the results, since in most cases everyone is interested in the effect of the change made on the whole product.

When you add only a part of our users to the test, the obtained changes in the metrics characterize the impact of the new feature on this group of users only. To understand how the whole product is affected, you need to make a series of calculations.

In the experiment described above, the increase in the number of users who made a purchase was 20% (remember, the experiment was designed in a way so that you only added users who abandoned the purchase to the A/B test). Let’s calculate what the overall impact on the metrics.

In the test group the users made 500 purchases after abandoning their previous shopping carts. In the control group the result was 400. If we consider the entire user base during the experiment, then there were 4,000 more users who made purchases right away in each group.

As a result, a 20% increase in the conversion of users abandoning their purchases translates to a 2% increase in the purchase conversion rate of the entire product (4,500 / 4,400 – 1 = 2%).

## How to log the data about A/B test

If you have your own infrastructure for experimentation, then feel free to simply create a table where you will store the information for each of the tests in the following way:

* User
* Experiment
* Group (control/test)
* Date and time added to the test

When you have this data handy, it won’t be difficult to calculate the metrics for the test and control groups in respect to the principles we’ve described above.

If you are using analytics software, you can add a property to the user with the name of the experiment and the test group’s title at the moment when this user becomes a part of the experiment. During your future analysis, you will simply need to filter events according to these properties. That's it.",t2_2c30i,Why your A/B tests take longer than they should,,t3_ewvtqf,0.73,5,,5,1580537073.0,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;When conducting experiments, teams usually include all the active users in their tests, or sometimes they tend to add all the new users who join the app during this test.

&lt;p&gt;Now imagine that we added to the experiment only those who could get some new experience while using the product. And those are the users who abandoned their shopping cart while making a purchase.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s calculate how changing the way of adding users to the test affected the conversion rate:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Purchase conversion for users who have become part of the experiment will be 6.6% (400 / 6,000) in the control group and 8.3% (500 / 6,000) in the test group.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This difference is statistically significant; even a smaller sample would have been enough to spot the effect of the change made.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you populate the experiment with users whose experience is not different in test and control groups, you create noise in the data. It makes it harder to notice the signal that comes from users who have experienced the change we made. If the key metric is greatly influenced by the users with a similar experience, then it will take you much longer to identify the effect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To draw an analogy, think of testing a drug. Let’s assume that for some reason, we add to the experiment not only people with the disease the drug is supposed to cure, but also people who are healthy. If we compare the proportion of healthy people in each of the groups after applying the drug, then healthy people will blur the drug effectiveness metrics intended to be tested on people who are sick.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the example with the abandoned purchases, the users who immediately made the purchase will have a more significant impact on the test results than those who abandoned their purchase. At the same time, the changes we are testing have no influence on the users who made a purchase right away. Adding these users to the test will blur the effect that the changes will have on the real target of the test (the users who abandoned the purchase). As a result, it will take us much longer to observe the effect of the change we’ve made.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One technical issue is worth noting here. You can add all the users you have to the A/B test, and then analyze only those who could have experienced something new in the product. You can do that, but in most cases it will require some manual work afterwards. If you somehow automate the analyzing part of your test, it is better to only include users who will have a new experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Use data only from the moment when users were added to the test&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is another way to blur the effect of the change you are testing. It happens when you take into account all the data from the moment when A/B test starts. To avoid this effect, you should only add data from the moment when each specific user becomes part of your test.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most users spot something new in the product not at the moment when you start the test, but a bit later. You add extra noise to your data if you consider the time between starting the test and the moment the user becomes a part of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s an example: You started the A/B test on April 1st. User X abandoned the purchase on April 10 and at this moment became a part of your experiment. It will be correct to consider data for this user only from April 10 when you will be calculating the metrics. The data obtained between April 1 and 10 doesn’t demonstrate the influence of the tested change on this user because her experience didn’t change during this period.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In the example above, adding such data will not affect the conversion to purchase rate, but it may well affect other metrics.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;How to understand the overall effect of a change made&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The described approach of adding users to experiments reduces the time required to identify the possible effect of the changes made to your product. However, it slightly complicates the interpretation of the results, since in most cases everyone is interested in the effect of the change made on the whole product.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you add only a part of our users to the test, the obtained changes in the metrics characterize the impact of the new feature on this group of users only. To understand how the whole product is affected, you need to make a series of calculations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the experiment described above, the increase in the number of users who made a purchase was 20% (remember, the experiment was designed in a way so that you only added users who abandoned the purchase to the A/B test). Let’s calculate what the overall impact on the metrics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the test group the users made 500 purchases after abandoning their previous shopping carts. In the control group the result was 400. If we consider the entire user base during the experiment, then there were 4,000 more users who made purchases right away in each group.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a result, a 20% increase in the conversion of users abandoning their purchases translates to a 2% increase in the purchase conversion rate of the entire product (4,500 / 4,400 – 1 = 2%).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;How to log the data about A/B test&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have your own infrastructure for experimentation, then feel free to simply create a table where you will store the information for each of the tests in the following way:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;User&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experiment&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Group (control/test)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Date and time added to the test&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you have this data handy, it won’t be difficult to calculate the metrics for the test and control groups in respect to the principles we’ve described above.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are using analytics software, you can add a property to the user with the name of the experiment and the test group’s title at the moment when this user becomes a part of the experiment. During your future analysis, you will simply need to filter events according to these properties. That&amp;#39;s it.&lt;/p&gt;

r/analytics,"Hi analysts!

I’ve got a final interview coming up for a role as a junior analyst and I’m a bit unsure how to prepare. 

I’ve already had an interview with HR, a technical test, a case study interview with two senior analysts and now I have a final interview with the MD/CMO of my country’s head office. 

I knew exactly how to prepare for the HR and case study interview. But I’m at a loss as to what this final interview is “testing for”.  The fact I’ve passed means they think I am a good fit and I have the analytic potential for the job. 

Do you think this interview is just be a final seal of approval and as long as I’m a normal person I’ll be alright?

Should I read up more on high level strategy and more external factors like competitors etc as potential topics to discuss?

I am also just planning on asking questions like what the MDs personal journey to this company was, what they like most about working at this company, if they can share any of the company’s next short term goals etc.

[https://imgur.com/mehchqa](https://imgur.com/mehchqa)

Check the image to see what I'm trying to do. This is a sheet primarily used by our Sales dept. to track leads. What I need to do is count the total sum of each column, group those 10 sums into 5 larger categories, and display that info in a pie chart (I'm sure there will be other applications but let's start there).

One caveat: I really cannot change the layout of this document. I might be able to eventually, but for now I really want to avoid requesting that.

Doing a simple Scorecard on one of these columns gives me the total just fine, but when I make a simple function to combine (\[PRODUCT A\] + \[PRODUCT B\]) it returns No data. What gives?

I thought I was onto the solution when I used a custom CASE field function to separate the data into my 5 big categories and viewed record count for each one, but the big problem there is the fact that the occasional .5's and 2's in the columns are counted as 1. And trying to make a field function which searches only for .5's doesn't really work because the .5's in the original sheet are always on the same row as another .5, so it's counted as a different record.

IDK how good of a job I'm doing describing this, but I think the desired goal is quite simple: I just need to be able to have a running total of leads in these 5 big categories using the Google Sheet I was provided, without making changes to said Sheet.

What I need to do is count the total sum of each column, group those 10 sums into 5 larger categories, and display that info in a pie chart (I&amp;#39;m sure there will be other applications but let&amp;#39;s start there).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One caveat: I really cannot change the layout of this document. I might be able to eventually, but for now I really want to avoid requesting that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Doing a simple Scorecard on one of these columns gives me the total just fine, but when I make a simple function to combine ([PRODUCT A] + [PRODUCT B]) it returns No data. What gives?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I thought I was onto the solution when I used a custom CASE field function to separate the data into my 5 big categories and viewed record count for each one, but the big problem there is the fact that the occasional .5&amp;#39;s and 2&amp;#39;s in the columns are counted as 1. And trying to make a field function which searches only for .5&amp;#39;s doesn&amp;#39;t really work because the .5&amp;#39;s in the original sheet are always on the same row as another .5, so it&amp;#39;s counted as a different record.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IDK how good of a job I&amp;#39;m doing describing this, but I think the desired goal is quite simple: I just need to be able to have a running total of leads in these 5 big categories using the Google Sheet I was provided, without making changes to said Sheet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any ideas? I feel like I&amp;#39;m making this way too complicated!&lt;/p&gt;

Hey all, I've been working on this all afternoon and I'm about at my wit's end! Hoping someone more experienced than me can help...

I'm building a Data Studio report for my company, and one of the things requested was a view into organic traffic split up into various content groupings on our site. For example, let's say we sell products related to red, orange, yellow, green, and blue. They want to know how often people enter the site because they clicked a page about blue, a page about red, etc etc, and they want to be able to see that graphed out over a dynamic time period.

I've created a field function that separates all of our pages into categories based on keywords found within the url, and I've managed to use this to display useful info via a table, a pie chart, and a pivot table. But now, I'm trying to graph Entrances for each of the topics over time in a line graph, and I just cannot figure out how to make it work.

The closest I've gotten is by using the aforementioned Pivot Table, which is successfully displaying my 6 categories (red, orange, yellow, green, blue, and other) in the Y axis, individual dates in the X column at the top of the table, and corresponding Landing Page data in the table itself (not quite the same as entrances, but if I try to use entrances it breaks the table. Just another thing to try to sort out later I guess). This displays dynamic data just fine, but I can't figure out a way to graph the numbers I'm seeing!

It feels like the real problem here is that I need to use three distinct points of data: the new field function that separates pages into keyword categories, dates, and entrances. Only a pivot table will show me all three as far as I can tell.

I'm like THIS close to just exporting this pivot table as a CSV, c/ping that into a Google Sheet, making that a new data source, and using it to build a line graph that way, but that seems absolutely absurd, not to mention I'd have to manually update the data. Please help me solve this before I go and do something crazy like that!!

r/analytics,"Let's imagine that a company’s management wants to allocate significant resources to the development of infrastructure that would increase their app’s speed. The hypothesis is that increasing the speed of the app will have a positive effect on the user experience and the key metrics.

Think of an experiment (an A/B test) to validate this hypothesis.

# Experiments where you make your product worse

The above-mentioned example is one of the challenges that my students face. Almost 70% of the students suggest speeding up the app and then measuring the effect using an A/B test.

Here’s why this approach is problematic: Optimizing the app’s speed is a costly process. And the goal of the experiment is to decide whether the effect of increasing the speed of the app is worth making the investment in designing and implementing the right components and modifications. But if you have to implement the speed upgrade just to conduct the experiment (and pay the costs), then what’s the point of the experiment in the first place?

A quick and inexpensive alternative to test this hypothesis is to use an experiment where you make your product worse. We will slow down the test version of the product (which is usually much simpler than implementing the speed optimization) and check whether doing so will have a negative impact on the key product metrics. If the impact is negative, then we can say that the speed of the app affects the key metrics and implement the speed upgrade. Thus, we should allocate resources to accelerate the product. If there is no measurable impact, then we can leave things as they are and avoid the costs of making a modification that will not have a substantial return on investment.

In reality, things are a bit more complicated. The dependency is not always linear. For example, the speed of a product may already be so low that its deterioration won’t affect the metrics in any way. The approach, however, stays the same. It simply shows the range of its applicability. We must consider such things when designing and interpreting the results of these experiments.

There’s a real-world example for this approach. The Financial Times conducted this experiment once. You can read about it here. From my personal experience I can say that this approach is widely used at Facebook and other big tech companies.

Only 30% of students suggested slowing down the app (it is worth noting that they weren’t given a hint within the article’s title). In real life, the percent of people who would dare make such as suggestion is much smaller. The percent of people who would actually do it would probably be close to zero.

In companies with a poor culture of experimenting and working with data, the idea of making the product worse will most likely meet resistance. Notably, even in companies where the data has already become an important part of the product development cycle, offering to conduct this type of experiment may well bewilder the product team members.

# Three stages of A/B testing evolution in companies

For most companies, A/B testing is a theoretical concept that has nothing to do with real work. Some companies use experiments to study the effect of new features and product changes on key metrics. However, only a few of them use experiments to determine what direction the product’s development should take.

Experiments make it possible to understand which levers influence the product and which don’t. They also measure how great the potential of each of the levers is. Without this information, prioritizing resources and projects looks more like making random guesses than a rational, calculated process.

Experiments where you make products worse is an effective tool to reduce uncertainty by first evaluating the potential impact of a particular product’s component on key metrics.

# Experiments where you make your product worse

Company X believes that push notifications is the driver for its app’s retention rate. For most companies, this simple assumption may be enough to assemble a dedicated team that will be in charge of push notifications. But the management of Company X wants to make sure that this is the best possible use of its resources. So it decides to experiment by disabling push notifications for some users. Once done, they will measure the impact of push notifications on the key product metrics.

The results of this experiment provide the foundation for making the right decision. The experiment will demonstrate the impact push notifications have on the app’s key metrics. Now that it has reliable information on whether a dedicated team could increase the effect, the company’s management can decide whether the investment is worth it.

This approach is applicable to a lot of hypotheses, which, at first glance, may seem like obvious ways to improve user metrics and experience, but in reality fail to do so.

*Suggestion:* Adding more levels will improve the game, because levels are the core concept of the game and holds everything else together.  
*How to verify:* Remove some of the available game levels for half of new users and examine the effect on the key metrics.

*Suggestion:* If the users don’t get a quick response from the support team, then we risk losing them. Therefore, we need to reduce the response time, and to do this we may …  
*How to verify:* We must form several customer cohorts who will receive replies from the support team at different speeds. Then we need to assess the effect of response time on key metrics.

*Suggestion:* We receive a lot of complaints regarding the quality of the search feature on our online store. We need to form a team that will be in charge of improving the search functionality.  
*How to verify:* First, we remove the search feature for some of the users and check whether the key metrics are affected. Then we will evaluate how much the team will be able to improve it, what benefits will it bring, how it relates to the overall cost of the project, and what other options are on the table.

Experiments are the only way to check whether an observed correlation between a product modification and key metric changes is causal or not. Such experiments help us test in a quick and affordable fashion how deteriorating a certain parameter affects key metrics. That is why they work so well when it comes to prioritizing projects.

# Cons of experiments where you make your product worse

Those who stand against this type of experiments say that deteriorating the product spoils user experience, increases churn rate, brings negative feedback and affects the brand reputation in a bad way.

Based on personal experience, I would say that this concern is greatly exaggerated. You will be surprised at how often degrading tests will have no significant effect on the product (and this is a very important piece of knowledge).

But even if there is a negative impact, then try looking at this issue from a different perspective. You have limited resources. One option is to distribute them between projects blindly (or almost blindly, that is, based on your current hypothesis about the product). In this case, you have an unknown chance of improving the user experience in the product. But you’ll have to spend several months to implement the new feature and evaluate its effect on the key metrics. If your experiment fails, you would have wasted precious resources and time that could have been spent on more impactful things.

Alternatively, you can conduct a series of quick degrading experiments, spoiling the experience of a small percentage of the product’s users for a short period. But as a result, you will cut down the time of reaching a conclusion and increase the chances of correctly distributing your resources. As a result, you will make the product better for all of its users, including those who will join in the future.

# Unintentional experiments where you make your product worse

If my arguments did not convince you to use this type of experiment intentionally, you can still benefit from it in other ways.

All companies run degrading experiments. Most of them are unintentional and happen when the team accidentally breaks something in the product.

The next time this happens in your company, do your best to make things right again, but also study the impact of the negative changes on the metrics. Thus observing the damage made can help you find a new lever of influence on the product.

The unintentional degrading experiment I made that influenced the product’s strategy

API.AI (now Dialogflow) is the company where I was developing the smart voice assistant Assistant.ai.

It was a very challenging task with no easy solutions at hand. Most services are built around solving one specific problem, and they do their best to solve it well. But in the case of our smart assistant, the expectations of users were so diverse that it was nearly impossible to choose the focus and design the perfect onboarding experience for new users.

Our initial strategy was to identify the most popular features and skills that users expected in an assistant. We would then place these features at the center of our product and build the onboarding flow around these skills (quite a challenging task for a product where the main interface is vocal, not visual). This approach led to a number of small victories. But due to natural limitations, such as the duration of the first session, the voice interface, and a huge variety of usage patterns, it led to a dead-end.

But then help came from an unexpected place when one day, our key product metrics fell by 20%.

It took us a whole week to investigate what was the matter. The fact that we had launched a new version of the product right before the drop only made things more complicated. As it turned out, the update had nothing to do with the drop in metrics. The reason was within the changes made in the third-party voice recognition service from Google, which we used on Android for some of the languages in our product.

Google had started to experiment with the way its voice recognition service detected the end of speech by examining pauses. The metrics dropped when Google decided to reduce the time it would wait for a person to continue talking. But in reality, while speaking, we often pause when we are thinking about what to say next. This is especially true for communication with virtual assistants when you ask it to do something (make a note or to add a reminder, etc). As a result, the users often didn’t have time to complete their sentence.

The decline in the quality of one of the fundamental technologies supporting the Assistant led to a greater change in metrics than any of the changes we had made earlier.

Our understanding of the product model and what was and wasn’t important changed dramatically after this unintentional degrading experiment. Before this incident, we had focused on what the Assistant could do and how it presented its skills to users. But then it became obvious that the quality of the key technologies that the product was built around (i.e., voice recognition and Natural Language Understanding \[NLU\]) is a much more powerful lever to improve the user experience and make the product better.

This kind of experience is crucial when discussing the prioritization of vital resources. This is the knowledge I obtained as a result of an unintentional experiment that made the product worse. Who knows what revelations your experiments will bring?

I also post lots of analytical articles in my blog. Happy to share :)",t2_2c30i,Running experiments where you make your product worse – the most underrated product manager tool,,t3_eq6gsh,0.92,27,,27,1579323871.0,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s imagine that a company’s management wants to allocate significant resources to the development of infrastructure that would increase their app’s speed. The hypothesis is that increasing the speed of the app will have a positive effect on the user experience and the key metrics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Think of an experiment (an A/B test) to validate this hypothesis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Experiments where you make your product worse&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The above-mentioned example is one of the challenges that my students face. Almost 70% of the students suggest speeding up the app and then measuring the effect using an A/B test.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s why this approach is problematic: Optimizing the app’s speed is a costly process. And the goal of the experiment is to decide whether the effect of increasing the speed of the app is worth making the investment in designing and implementing the right components and modifications. But if you have to implement the speed upgrade just to conduct the experiment (and pay the costs), then what’s the point of the experiment in the first place?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A quick and inexpensive alternative to test this hypothesis is to use an experiment where you make your product worse. We will slow down the test version of the product (which is usually much simpler than implementing the speed optimization) and check whether doing so will have a negative impact on the key product metrics. If the impact is negative, then we can say that the speed of the app affects the key metrics and implement the speed upgrade. Thus, we should allocate resources to accelerate the product. If there is no measurable impact, then we can leave things as they are and avoid the costs of making a modification that will not have a substantial return on investment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In reality, things are a bit more complicated. The dependency is not always linear. For example, the speed of a product may already be so low that its deterioration won’t affect the metrics in any way. The approach, however, stays the same. It simply shows the range of its applicability. We must consider such things when designing and interpreting the results of these experiments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s a real-world example for this approach. The Financial Times conducted this experiment once. You can read about it here. From my personal experience I can say that this approach is widely used at Facebook and other big tech companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Only 30% of students suggested slowing down the app (it is worth noting that they weren’t given a hint within the article’s title). In real life, the percent of people who would dare make such as suggestion is much smaller. The percent of people who would actually do it would probably be close to zero.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In companies with a poor culture of experimenting and working with data, the idea of making the product worse will most likely meet resistance. Notably, even in companies where the data has already become an important part of the product development cycle, offering to conduct this type of experiment may well bewilder the product team members.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Three stages of A/B testing evolution in companies&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For most companies, A/B testing is a theoretical concept that has nothing to do with real work. Some companies use experiments to study the effect of new features and product changes on key metrics. However, only a few of them use experiments to determine what direction the product’s development should take.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Experiments make it possible to understand which levers influence the product and which don’t. They also measure how great the potential of each of the levers is. Without this information, prioritizing resources and projects looks more like making random guesses than a rational, calculated process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Experiments where you make products worse is an effective tool to reduce uncertainty by first evaluating the potential impact of a particular product’s component on key metrics.&lt;/p&gt;

Since GA for app has moved to Firebase, we have been backing up our data but the GA API will only allow us to pull data from 2 years back for some reason. This means we will be losing a lot of historical data when the data is wiped at the end of this month.

Also our app cohort analysis will have already been broken (tracking stopped in Oct 2019), is there any way to bridge these cohorts into Firebase or will upgrading to 360 allow us to maintain the cohorts (or is the break in tracking already irriverable?).

r/analytics,"Hi guys

Currently, we're facing a big discrepancy between the metrics for link clicks we see on various platforms (Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, LinkedIn) and the number of sessions we're tracking in Google Analytics.

We're aware that typically GA shows fewer sessions, e.g. because people jump off before the page loads, don't accept the tracking of cookies, etc. However, the discrepancy is so big (*4 or 5 times*) that we feel this doesn't explain it. On Twitter, for example, the difference is around 1'400 link clicks vs. 250 sessions in GA.

There is also an indicator that the problem is bigger on sessions recorded for mobile than for such tracked on desktop devices.

Would anybody have an idea of how we could find out what the problem is or knows a good article that helps with troubleshooting?

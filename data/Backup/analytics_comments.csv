I also don't build any data tools, all of our projects are run through tables and sheets pre-made for us by the company data nerds.

I am interested in expanding my skill set and potentially changing gears into a new industry. I really like SCM / logistics, but I am interested in sustainability / research roles / leveling up my abilities. Right now I feel like I'm at a great crossroads, but do not have a mentor or a strong enough pull in any direction to make a decision.

I've got a degree from a business school in Data Analytics where I learned forecasting methods, SQL, SAS, and Tableau. 
I've been working as a data analyst for over a year and have decided to go to graduate school to advance my career. In my current role, I use SQL, SAS, and Tableau to create reports and dashboards as needed. I've got two options:

Masters of Science in Data Analytics (MSDA):
 This program focuses on SQL, SAS, Tableau,       Python and R. It's a new program at my school but I would mainly be spending a lot of money for skills I never use (Python and R). 

MBA with a concentration in Data Analytics:
This program focuses on SQL, SAS, and Tableau. An MBA would give me a more broad education and allow me to strengthen what I currently know. 

I feel as thought the MSDA program is more geared to Data Science, which is not something I'm 100% sold on doing. In regards to the potential skill gap between the two programs, I'm using Datacamp to learn Python, R, and Machine Learning.

I’m looking into transitioning to the US from Sweden in the upcoming years. Haven’t decided on the state yet but somewhere near a HCOL area with decent job opportunities.

I’m currently working as a CRM Analyst at a small boutique consultancy firm. Since it’s within consultancy I get to try out a lot of different roles and projects. I’ve worked mostly within FMCG/Retail and e-commerce with some added experience within finance. I studied majored in Statistics and minored in economics and political science. However, I never finished my bachelor thesis because I managed to land a job before and Working full-time just took up all my time. Really underestimated the workload in consultancy. 

My technical competences is mainly SQL and Excel. Can model in Python or R and have worked with SAS Enterprise when I worked in Finance but wouldn’t say I’m anywhere near proficient enough to do it without guidande. 

Besides that I’m also the lead analyst within some accounts at the firm so a lot of my time goes to planning, stakeholder management and presentations (reports, sales meetings etc), onboarding Jr colleagues and developing my stream. 

I’m not looking into any specific industry och specific analytics position but would to know any tips on what I should consider when applying for Jobs.

Since I don’t have my bachelor degree I’m guessing that’s going to be a problem. I’m hoping my work experience will outweigh my lack in education. 

How difficult is it to find a decent job with work experience instead of a degree? (I did study more than a bachelor but just didn’t turn in a complete version of my thesis)

MIS is nice for learning the tools, but it probably won’t teach you a lot of the strategy I prefer to see. It’s about building systems, but your goal should be to build a good company, using your abilities in building systems.

I do Business Intelligence and Analytics, and I use confidence intervals maybe a couple times a year when an exec asks for it, I do advanced modeling every once in a while, but generally simpler models are better when doing new things (my work always is) and most decisions I’m guiding are left/right decisions where understanding risk/reward and probability are more important than statistics as a field. I get statistics, I was quite good at it in school, but I find that it’s suited to academic publishing and not as well suited to business use cases.

If you’re doing a cost benefit analysis on something that costs $30/unit and maybe returns $100-150, who really cares whether it’s $100 or $110 or $150 returned? The answer is always go! If it’s close enough for advanced statistical techniques to be needed, it’s likely not that profitable of an addition. There are a million caveats to this, and if I could find an algorithm for 51% win rate in the stock market then yeah, use advanced statistics, but a lot of business is getting Thing A from Place B to Place C, so find your big wins quickly and make a shitload of good but imprecise decisions over a few slow precise decisions is my M.O.

Stats probably looks the best as a degree, but if you go that route, I highly recommend reading Nassim Nicholas Taleb’s Incerto series (fooled by randomness, antifragile - my favorite, skin in the game, the black swan, and I think there’s another), especially if you are working outside of insurance/academics.

I switched halfway through a mechanical eng degree to economics, added a math minor, spent 4 years at Tesla leading an analytics team. Won a bunch of math contests in high school.

But I didn’t use fancy math, my goal is to bring clarity and simplicity, to bring intuitive understanding, simplified operations, and productive incentives to the team leads and guide them towards a fail proof system.

Charlie munger says “never ever think about something else when you should be thinking about incentives”.

In analytics, math is your tool, but strategic reasoning should be your competitive advantage over another analyst. I personally would recommend something like comp sci and industrial engineering, to understand your tool and what you’re analyzing, but I know that’s a lot and employers might think it’s weird, but people only look at your degree for your first job, and your skills gained will last you 40 years.","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Honestly, I haven’t enjoyed working with stats majors, though a solid basis in stats is definitely valuable. “To someone with a hammer, everything looks like a nail” is a common trait of stats majors in my experience.&lt;/p&gt;

In my experience, most your time spent as a analyst) data scientist is producing a model but educating stakeholders on uncertainty of results.

Here's a simple example - in a regression analysis, without variability in an independent variable, we cannot attribute importance.

What that means in real world in something like marketing when doing a mix marketing model, is that if the client pays a fixed amount on a type of advertising each month, we can't create an accurate model to show it's effect on an ROI.

So take a course that will explain what's happening in underneath the model and always be applying that to things occuring in business life.

1,fvd70au,juleswp,1,t2_r6egb,"So I would suggest basic algebra, working up to basic calculus. Then learn probability and stats. Most of your tools will do the mathematically heavy lifting for you, but it's extremely important to understand the requirements and limitations of the techniques you're using. What is a BLUE estimator and why is it important? When can you use regression? What are it's limitations? How do you develop confidence intervals? How does the distribution of the data limit what you can do with it statistically? What are some different distributions? 

Everyone scoffs when I say algebra, but I promise it keeps coming up in higher level math (looking at you damned calculus). Also, and I may get some disagreement here, calculus in really just more advanced algebra. It has a few of its own new principles which are invaluable, but a lot of transformations algebraically take place. 

If you're doing forecasting, I would also spend time with arima modeling...I frequently run across time series data that is done poorly. 

Soft skills are great, and you're way ahead there, but it doesn't help if you have to start choosing how to analyze data and can't pick mathematically appropriate methods to do or avoid.

Then talk about that in your next interview as well.

Edit: Also keep in mind (assuming you are in the USA) we just shut down nearly the entire country for a bit. Hiring is basically frozen across the board.

1. Get creative. Brainstorm non-profits you could help. Do any of your target companies contribute or partner with charities?

2. After you find a non-profit to help, consider writing about what you're doing on Linkedin, Medium, or your own blog. You can prove that you have experience, and it'll demonstrate your abilities. 
&amp;nbsp;

3. Approach smaller firms. Offer to do an internship, or project-based gig. Ask your old professors, old classmates, etc. if they know of any internship leads, or entry-level roles. 
&amp;nbsp;

4. Look for contractor gigs on Upwork.

I had three solid possible jobs, and two acceptances, all at once.

Then you have the data science types that often have some cool degrees but don't want to get their hands dirty. 

So here's the thing. There are so many ways you can go with a background in analytics. Give it a year, deal with the shit, and take some self-paced courses or talk to others in the field. You'll find you have many more options than if you punch out now.  Plus you'll be able to relate better to others that come along.

For this explanation, I'll ignore events.

""Time on page"" is measured by the difference between the timestamp the user opened the page and the timestamp when the user opened another page. So we have ""average time on page"" as the total time on that page of all sessions that saw that page divided by the amount of sessions that saw that page.

""Time on site"" or ""session duration"" is measured by the difference between the timestamp of the first page an user saw in a session and the timestamp of the last, with at most 30 minutes between each page. So we have the ""average session duration"" being the total time of the sessions divided by number of sessions.

With that, we have a lot of stuff to unpack:
* Sessions that see page X but don't see anything after that add 0 time, but still count for the division (the average)
* Sessions that see only one page have a session duration of 0, but still count for the average
* It is very common to see a large avg time on page for pages that are deep in the website: if an user got there, they usually continue to somewhere else
* That is also true for pages that are seen multiple times in a single session. Like a search results page
* Most of the sessions in your website are bounces, thus have 0 time to add, but still are counted. Thus your low ""avg time on site""","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;You stumbled upon a hard question to answer.&lt;/p&gt;

**Time on Page** and **Session Duration** are one of the most misunderstood metrics in Google Analytics. Talking about **“Time on page,”** it is calculated by the difference in time between the point a user visits or lands on the page and when they move on to the next one. It is considered as 0 if the user exits the page without going to another one.  


While on the other hand **“Session Duration”** is considered as the time frame in which there are continuous and regular interactions from the user on a website. The session is timed out when no activity is performed by the user for a definite duration ( 30 minutes ). It takes the entire time into account a person spends on the website. You may consider it as an effective sum of the time on each page that he visited during his entire single session.  
Averages are calculated by the following method:  
**Avg. time on page** = Total time-on-page for multiple users/(Total number of users – Total number of exits)  
**Avg. session duration** = Total time spent on the website by multiple users/Total number of users

According to Google, average session duration is calculated by dividing the total duration of all sessions (in seconds) by the number of sessions. Basically, it measures how long users spend interacting with your site (on average) before exiting. While that may sound fairly straightforward, there are a lot of layers that can affect how this metric is calculated and how it can be interpreted.

To illustrate how session duration is calculated, here’s a simple example:

* A user lands on a page on your site at 12:00pm.
* The user reads through the page, and clicks to a second page at 12:05pm.
* The user exits your site after clicking through to the second page.
* In this instance, session duration would be calculated as 12:00pm–12:05pm = 5 minutes.

Hello,

Yes, you can obviously see your users for all your pages, but you cannot see that in Behavior &gt; Site Content &gt; All pages. For that, you need to create a custom report. For creating a custom report just follow:  
Customization &gt; Custom Report &gt; +New Custom Report.  
Now, give a suitable title to your report and name to your Report Content. Now in the Metric Group select **“users”** and in the Dimension Drilldowns select **“Page.”**  
Now you will be able to view your users on every page.  
Thank You,

I used every economics project as an excuse to practice data-science methods, so I came out of my program with a decent portfolio and some outside-the-box project experience. The combination of that and my econometrics got me my first and current job. My skills outside of CS/DS helped me because I brought specialization, and I would expect your marketing knowledge to give you a similar advantage.

I'm being very blunt here, so please don't take it personally: business school is not taken seriously by the majority of the people I know in CS, econ, and stats. That's unfair generalization on their/our part, but you'll be a competitive candidate with project portfolio and the ability to clearly communicate your skills and problem-solving methods.

What's your background like? Have you done much with database systems and distributed systems? Getting an online cert and a project or two done on AWS or another cloud service will make you quite attractive. 

My advice is: within your work in CIS classes, try to find a way to integrate your marketing background, and polish those projects until they're something you'd want to show recruiters. There is an incredible amount of work available for marketing analytics, and a some practice building and handling the data-engineering side of that would make you an amazing candidate. However, keep in mind the huge difference between roles of a marketing analyst running Google Analytics, and a data-engineer building ETL infrastructure.

Never forget to play up your people-skills; I would assume that you have an advantage in communication/soft-skills compared to a lot of people in our field. If you apply to smaller companies and startups, if they know what they're doing, you'll have an advantage because of the varying responsibilities that naturally come with a small firm. Not guaranteed, but it worked for me.

Finally, if you're up for another year of school, I interviewed some folks from NCSU's MS Analtyics for a position at my company last fall, and they seemed to have a similar background to you but with an extra year of hardcore hands-on experience. It's only a year long and they work hard to place folks, may be worth looking into.

8,ftczwrk,memberdecember2,8,t2_6mbmw0lv,"Having done some segmentation work in a professional setting before, here are my 2 cents:

1. You want to define key drivers of your dependent variable
- You mention that the dependent variable is likeliness to pay on time etc.First, you want to highlight any variables that may affect this - this may be client age, number of products client has purchased etc. No need to be parsimonious at this stage - include any variables that you think may be relevant.

2. Run a random forest on the data, assuming you have historic data - predict ‘likeliness to pay’ based on variables identified above
- You can then run a variable importance to identify the key drivers behind your dependent variable ie. likeliness to pay etc.
- There are other algorithms that perform a similar function - random forests are good though as they make few statistical assumptions on the data

3. Add a commercial overlay
- Once you have identified your key variables, try to segment in a way that ‘makes sense’. For example, the region that your client comes from may be determined to be 3rd most important driver of ‘likeliness to pay’. However, if your businesses’ processes are already attuned to managing by region, then this may practically become a more important variable.

4. Data ethics
- Data by nature may be biased due to lack of confounding factors - before you segment, ensure that you apply some data ethics such that you think carefully before concluding that variables like ‘race’ is a key driver of ‘likeliness to pay’. Often times, there is an external confounding factor that can explain this relationship eg. Income. We all have a responsibility to ensure the conclusions we make are measured and don’t perpetuate discrimination.


After you have defined segments using process above, look at key metrics across segments to see if they lead to heterogeneous results eg. Each segment leads to a different shade of ‘likeliness to pay’ amongst other metrics.

I hope this help - you may have to do a bit of googling to fill in some knowledge gaps above eg. Variable importance plot!","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having done some segmentation work in a professional setting before, here are my 2 cents:&lt;/p&gt;

Python/R are programming languages most often used for EDA, building machine learning models and scaling across the organization if a script is well written.

Tableau is meant as a business intelligence tool, more for data visualization and end-users to self-diagnose and monitor trends. 

In terms of importance, I'd say SQL followed by a BI tool of your company's current stack. Google Data Studio is probably one of the easiest to get into, but it's pretty limited in functionalities compared to the rest of the usual suspects but it's an easy start. 

Python/R is great but it obviously has a relatively higher learning curve. Also if your company's data isn't immense, some data analyzing asks can be broken down to manageable portions with the right queries and EDA can be done via traditional spreadsheet software.

Variable 2 is binary. It's either yes or no. So it receives a score of 1 for yes and 0 for no.

9,fsxvupd,catelemnis,9,t2_lxh2nhg,"Depends on the use case. Tableau is hella expensive for starters. It‘s also very heavy so can get bogged down if there’s too much data. And it works best if you have clean data to connect to. If I’m already cleaning the data with Python, then it could be easier to just do the whole thing in python and output the graphs too.

I had a project at a previous job where I had to clean and filter 10 TB of logs to pick out specific IP addresses and show their traffic against our network. We didn’t have a database to query: the logs were stored in files where each file had up to 1 hour’s worth of traffic, and I had to look at 6 months of data.

I used a python script to go through the files and filter them for those IP addresses. Since I was already using python to filter and clean the data, I also had it output the line graphs as it went so we could see the traffic spikes from those IP addresses for each day.

If I were to do that last step in Tableau I would have had to export the cleaned data into a format for Tableau to connect to: so maybe one csv file for each day, or one giant file for all of it that Tableau probably would crash on, or set up a local database on my laptop to store the data (though at this point in my career I’d never used databases so I would not have thought to do this). And then I would have to start building graphs for the data manually. It would have been a tedious workflow. With the script I just click it and let it run while I go do something else. and when it’s done I have a bunch of graphs for each day of those 6 months.


At my current job I pull data from the database to build a forecast against. In order to assess the forecast I output plots showing the model compared to the actuals. This graph isn’t for anyone else but me. To use Tableau I’d have to export the model results into a file so I can then open Tableau, connect to the file, then build a graph, only to decide I don’t like it so I tweak a parameter then have to export a new dataset and connect to it with Tableau again. It interrupts the workflow when everything else I’m doing is in python. Right now in my Jupyter notebook I have one cell where I tweak the parameters and then it spits out the model graphs with those new parameters. So I can see immediately if I like the way the model performs.

So I guess one key issue is that for a workflow that moves from Python to Tableau you need to export the data, and sometimes that’s not ideal. sometimes it’s easier to keep everything in the script.

EDIT: I use Tableau for reporting dashboards connected to our database. Tableau allows for more interactivity and is easier to make plots with than coding.

Power BI has lots of import options for data. From Excel file imports to SQL queries. Files are the easiest.

Data modeling is using power query to transform your input data into the tables you need - import from Excel, rename column, filter rows, etc. - then creating relationships between those tables for column lookups if needed - all of this is within Power BI unless you have some special need to manipulate data before importing.

The UI is made of drag and drop visuals that are mostly self explanatory. DAX is used to create additional columns and measures at the user interface level (as opposed to within the query). You can do the same things in power query that you can do in DAX - I would say Power Query has more options, DAX can be more convenient for small changes.

Business majors are usually at a disadvantage because they do not have as strong of a quantitative background (it&amp;#39;s easier for engineers to pick up the business skills than for businessmen to learn advanced math/stats).  The caveat to this is people with technical backgrounds who go on to get an MBA or MSBA.&lt;/p&gt;

3,fshvq1r,MindlessTime,3,t2_jqnnc,"TL;DR — Start with SQL. Pick R or python. Try to go to some meetups (virtual now but ideally in person when that can happen again) for either R or python to get a feel for the community.

First off, SQL is a language meant for one thing and one thing only — storing, organizing, and querying data in databases. R is more general purpose but leans towards analytics. python is general purpose.

Learn SQL first. It has the most wide-ranging applicability. It’s been around longer and will be around longer. It’s a good way to learn how data is organized and how to get it from point A to point C in the right format.

Between R and python, it depends. Right now python is more marketable. It has better libraries for machine learning and predictive analytics. But moreover, managers who don’t know what they’re talking about now think that python is the magic skill they’re looking for. I’ve talked to people at companies who look for people who know python even if they won’t be using g it because they assume it means they’re rocket science programmers or something. It’s widely used in Silicon Valley, and every company now wants to “digital transform” into a tech company, so that might have something to do with it. I don’t mean to knock python. It’s really good for a lot of things and much “cleaner”, easier to learn and use, less byzantine.

IMO, R is much better for most analytics. It’s built for statistical analysis and making sense of data. python’s data science modules on the other hand are more built for engineering predictive models. This is where I get opinionated, so sorry about that. But I always thought of R as the “thinking person’s” analytics language. It is widely used in academia and has packages for very specific types of analysis that go deeper than python counterparts. I personally think the ggplot2 package is the best graphing software there is, largely for its conceptual approach to the subject. And I like the R community a lot. Having gone to meetups for both R and python, the R crowd is both more impressive and more laid back. That said, it’s fallen out of favor in industry (though it seems to be replacing SAS in some).

The last thing I would recommend is to go to meetups. You’ll be surrounded by people who are smarter and know more than you and that’s fine. It’s a great place to learn and be exposed to new things from people who actually use them, not some guy who made a tutorial to get views on YouTube.","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;TL;DR — Start with SQL.

I ended up moving to another state after just a few months in that role (following a lifelong dream).  Now I&amp;#39;m in a role that still includes analytics, but is more focused on process and systems analysis, which is really where my forte lies.  I&amp;#39;m working toward a green belt in LEAN, but I am also learning PowerBI in tandem with our department&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;actual&amp;quot; analytics team.  It&amp;#39;s fascinating stuff to me.  Sometimes it&amp;#39;s really difficult for me to grasp, but once I do, it&amp;#39;s quite exhilarating!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Honestly I don&amp;#39;t earn a much bigger salary now than I did when I was simply an HR Coordinator or Exec Assistant or whatever, but the work is so much more satisfying and interesting to me.  I used to struggle to get through the days due to boredom, but I often get chased out of my office at the end of the day now by my boss because it&amp;#39;s hard to tear myself away from my projects.&lt;/p&gt;

It seems like you're thinking of people as cogs in a machine rather. But they're not (tho machines are :)). So argument goes that they're not getting freed up ""for other work"" but ""freed from inhuman type work"" to do other, more human stuff. One piece of evidence is the number of leisure activities now available to the average person. For almost all of human history there were very few of those, but over the course of the last 50 they've exploded b/c people have more time to devote to that stuff (not just frees them up to do other work -- frees them up to be human). 

That said, I'd be a lot more optimistic if there were a UBI or something like it as a safety net to allow people to pursue their passions b/c you do raise some salient points on the cutthroat nature of American capitalism.

So argument goes that they&amp;#39;re not getting freed up &amp;quot;for other work&amp;quot; but &amp;quot;freed from inhuman type work&amp;quot; to do other, more human stuff. One piece of evidence is the number of leisure activities now available to the average person. For almost all of human history there were very few of those, but over the course of the last 50 they&amp;#39;ve exploded b/c people have more time to devote to that stuff (not just frees them up to do other work -- frees them up to be human). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That said, I&amp;#39;d be a lot more optimistic if there were a UBI or something like it as a safety net to allow people to pursue their passions b/c you do raise some salient points on the cutthroat nature of American capitalism. All in all I think it&amp;#39;s an awesome time to be alive, though. Another piece of evidence: If I gave you the option to live in present era or during an era selected uniformly at random from all human history you&amp;#39;d be insane not to select now.&lt;/p&gt;

26,fs3n219,TheDataGentleman,26,t2_6jsoipfe,"I have experience in both. I will try and outline some of the pros and cons plus my personal choice below.

Consulting firms:

Pros:

- If the consulting company is big you get to travel across the country you are in and work with different businesses.

- Get to connect with different people in the consulting company.

- You never really form a ""team"" and are usually working alone or in a small team until the project ends. This means maybe not much politics.

Cons:

- You are essentially a warm body for these companies. They will charge $1500 a day to the client and maybe you see about $200 a day even though you do all the work.

- If the consulting business is quiet, usually the consultants are fired and exposed to losing the job.

- Growth is maybe limited if you want to learn different tech, the more specialist you become in something, the more they will give you that work.

- A lot of your personal time goes into travel. Usually Sundays and after work on weekdays commuting back to home. It may be good while you are young, I don't know. I don't know how things will change due to covid.

- There is a lot of pressure. You are sold as an ""expert"" to the consulting companies clients with limited training and experience. In the end on the ground if the client is unhappy it will be you who has to deal with it. There are some good cases where if you have a good manager this may not be the case but I find nowdays with so much technology the company hardly knows anything and so it is up to you.

- There is much more security with the job if you are a developer in-house for a company.

- Compared to consulting companies, if you do not have work or it is quiet, you are maybe not going to get fired as quickly.

- If staying in one location is important to you (e.g. family, relationships etc) then in-house could be better.

- Depending on the company, you have more opportunity to learn if you they have a good technology stack and a manager willing to help you grow.

- In my experience I grew much more in understanding specific technologies working in-house because I was able to dedicated many months and years towards delivering something. This was not possible via consulting because usually clients cannot afford to pay so much money for a consultant for a long time or you get moved around because you are needed elsewhere.

Cons:

- You don't get to travel as much as a consulting job if you like travelling.

- Not much exposure to different businesses.


-------------------------------------------------

Overall I quite enjoy in-house.

These are some very quick things I can think of. Will be good to hear from others.

EDIT: Bullet point formatting fixed.","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have experience in both. I will try and outline some of the pros and cons plus my personal choice below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consulting firms:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pros:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the consulting company is big you get to travel across the country you are in and work with different businesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Get to connect with different people in the consulting company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;You never really form a &amp;quot;team&amp;quot; and are usually working alone or in a small team until the project ends. This means maybe not much politics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cons:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;You are essentially a warm body for these companies. They will charge $1500 a day to the client and maybe you see about $200 a day even though you do all the work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the consulting business is quiet, usually the consultants are fired and exposed to losing the job.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Growth is maybe limited if you want to learn different tech, the more specialist you become in something, the more they will give you that work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A lot of your personal time goes into travel. Usually Sundays and after work on weekdays commuting back to home. It may be good while you are young, I don&amp;#39;t know. I don&amp;#39;t know how things will change due to covid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is a lot of pressure. You are sold as an &amp;quot;expert&amp;quot; to the consulting companies clients with limited training and experience. In the end on the ground if the client is unhappy it will be you who has to deal with it. There are some good cases where if you have a good manager this may not be the case but I find nowdays with so much technology the company hardly knows anything and so it is up to you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

6,fs46qn8,nirst,6,t2_ga309,"Wow some people have worked for some terrible consulting companies! As someone who has worked for the same consultancy for almost 15 years, I'm pretty biased in the other direction. I'd say not all consultancies are the same, so make sure you get a feel for the culture and expectations of the company you're looking into. Some of the benefits I think are:
* Exposure to lots of different customers and problems brings lots of experience of different types of work.
* You're surrounded by experts - if you haven't seen something before there may be someone in the team who has. You learn more and faster.
* Opportunities for training - good consultancies need expert consultants so training is more readily available on the company.
* Travel was mentioned although in the UK at least that's not as prevalent as it used to be. Most of my work is done remotely from home or in our office.
* Pay is usually higher in a good consultancy than an in house role.

I understand the comments others have made  about poor job security, but we've never had that issue. Many of our consultants have worked for us for years and I think that's the mark of a well run consultancy that isnt overexposed to a single client or technology and is constantly bringing in new work while maintaining good relationships with existing clients.","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wow some people have worked for some terrible consulting companies!

Yes you can. It’s not as easy as some others here make it sound. A lot of companies don’t see MBA as a quantitatively rigorous study. If you’re applying for Data Analyst or Data Scientists positions you’ll be competing with MS Stem grads. MBA is not the typical pedigree for analytics.

That said, there is a huge shortage of business-minded people in analytics right now IMO. The whole case study methodology of the MBA — reading about companies in situations, being inventive and figuring out what to do without a clear right answer — that’s an incredibly valuable skill.

My best advice is abstract away from technical information as much as possible - you either get glazed over eyes or people think you’re a pompous jerk.

Fundamentally, analytics is the process of conducting “analysis” - a term people are usually more familiar with - and it’s important to explain to your boss or mother that there’s a lot of work to do before we can bust out the calculator, excel sheet, etc. And there’s even work to do after we do analysis. For example, we need to make sure we have data to analyze and that we can trust it, we need to make sure we have the right tool or program or technique to do the analysis, and then we need to pick the right way to visualize our results so people understand it easily. There’s a lot more to it than just “analysis.”

An example I like is the process of writing a book report as a form of “literary” analytics. We start with a question to answer: something like what are the most common themes of science fiction books? To answer that, we need to first pick a good selection of sci-fi books, read them, and take notes to pick out the important stuff. That’s data preparation and cleansing. Then we need to think about how we want to answer it and pick out evidence from our notes to support it - that’s data analysis. And finally, we need to pick a way to deliver our report - do we write an essay, deliver a presentation to the class, perform a clever rap? That’s data visualization.

If you’ve read this far and you haven’t lost your own audience - you can then typically help them understand there are lots of questions to analyze, but they typically break in to 4 types:
What happened in the past? - descriptive analytics
Why did that happen? - diagnostic analytics
What will happen? - predictive analytics
What should we do and when should we do something? - prescriptive analytics

But you could still be better off learning to use the tools on your own first, trying to land an entry job with just that, and if you managed to get one, then you would know that investing in a proper educational program would be beneficial in getting you to grow in that career.","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can learn these skills for free online, especially in programs that allow you to audit the course and choose to purchase a certificate later on if you want something to show. Lots of reputable universities offer courses for such programs, and teach you not just how to use the tools, but when and how (strategy). I&amp;#39;ve done a course by Microsoft on storytelling with data using Power BI for example that is more than a tutorial on how to use the tool, and a certificate was a paid option, but the course was for free. So no, in this day and age, 30k debt for a degree that teaches you how to use tools is not worth it.

The thing about this program - which sounds too quick/compact BTW - is that you go an MS program in order to network, possibly gain internships, and learn directly from qualified professors. 

Can you learn Tableau by taking online classes? Absolutely. If that's all you think you need, go for it. (By the way, I use Power BI for work and I feel it's superior to Tableau. Just my 2 cents). 

If you don't think you'll need to do applied math (it sounds like you don't), don't need the paper that says ""M.S."" on it,  the program might not really be of much use to you, especially at 30K.

But if you like to network and plan to use career services, the programs can really open up doors. An autonomous driving company that I like invited me to apply for their internship program based solely on the recommendation of my professor, in person, over lunch at a conference.

I would say that the easiest way is that you add a fourth column in which you divide time by action, so that for day 1 you would get 5/1, for day 2 it would be 5/5,...  Then, you calculate the average for group 1 and the average for group 2. That would make data ready for the t-test.

If you calculated the ratio the other way round as you were considering, what you would get is the number of actions that you can make for unit of time. In first day you would get 1/5 = 0,2, which means that in the first day a person (or animal, or wahtever) made 0,2 actions in 1 minute or second (depending on how you are measuring time). It's also valid, now you need to see want you want to compare.

`PAGE equals /page-a`  OR `PAGE equals /page-b` OR `PAGE equals /page-c`

If that's the problem you're trying to solve, then I'd suggest using the Regular Expression option of the filter, and the OR character:  `|`

Regular expressions are ways to describe patterns in text or what the text you're searching should match. So, in this case, you could say:  
`PAGE matches regex /page-a|/page-b|/page-c`

There are plenty of ways to understand navigation in GA. For instance, try this on for size.

1. Go to your All Pages report 
2. Search and click on your Listicle post
3. Scroll up to right below the Segment bar, and choose ""Navigation Summary""

Create a segment where Landing Page is Listicle post. Then look at the All Pages report. This will show you all the pages visited when a session was started on that Listicle post.

I work at an agency where I do most of our analytics on the side, and for most clients, Google Analytics is the only thing they care to look at. I'd strongly recommend learning Data Studio \*and\* Tableau, if you're going to learn one of them. If you're planning to work for a specific business that uses Tableau, that's fine, but if you're looking to try the field or land in an agency/freelance environment, experience with both is great to have.

&amp;#x200B;

It would also be beneficial for you to have an understanding of the other kinds of tools you'll need for web performance analysis. CrazyEgg is a big one, as is Google Optimize. These help provide insight into specific UI/UX experiments so you can make iterative improvements. 

&amp;#x200B;

There are also other platforms that will be involved in your day-to-day reporting with their own analysis tools beyond your own website's performance, like Google Ads and Facebook ads. Understanding these and knowing what factors affect performance can help you to make accurate analysis on a) likely your business' biggest marketing expenditure and b) something that can directly drive revenue, which is one of the most important things a digital analyst needs to be able to have an impact on. 

&amp;#x200B;

Also, it still depends on what you're really looking to get into, but getting a good understanding of (organic) social media metrics will help a lot. An entry-level job in web analytics is likely going to involve analysing a stack as simple as basic acquisition/page performance metrics and social media stats, plus any advertising mediums you're using, and making simple recommendations on improving performance. 

&amp;#x200B;

In a more advanced situation, you might be asked to do something like manually export sales performance data from an ecommerce store and load that into Tableau or Data Studio for visualization. 

&amp;#x200B;

Honestly, from a pure web analytics perspective, a rudimentary understanding of statistics is nice, but unnecessary. It's far more important you understand the 'so whats' of the data you're looking at, which means general marketing knowledge (and broad knowledge of the more commonly used tools and platforms) is more immediately useful than statistical knowledge. At least, that's my experience of it.

For job part:

I know you may have just graduated, but why did you pursue this program? Why do you want to do Data Analyst or Data Scientist? Any job, even an entry level job, would ask this basic question of why you want to do what you want to do. What is driving you to analyze data? This will help narrow down to what job you want. Most entry level roles are Associate/Entry Business Analyst, Social Media Analyst, Merchandising Analyst, etc. Titles and industry may vary, and some require their own domain expertise, but the technique and skill needed for each job is the same.

As a hiring manager,  I look at the person's passion for data collection and data analysis. And simply applying because you graduated from a program that teaches the subject does not mean much for me personally.

So far, when it comes to entry-level roles, it has always been those personal projects or initiatives that attracted me to read a resume or consider them for interviews. Someone loves tennis a lot that they decided to build a visualization on tennis matches, another likes to do basic ML to detect if it's a whale sound or not. How would you apply your learnings currently?

We're lucky we're not in a field where we need a workshop, a live patient, or sit in a factory to gain experience. There's a lot of data out there, and there's a lot we can do with it. Even the simplest of data visualization is a great experience ([https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/) is a great place to learn how people process data from public/available sources).

1) standardizing, processing, optimizing (Business Intelligence roles)

Most legitimate Data Scientists I’ve worked with in the industry have a long background in stats or math, they usually have a PhD in these fields. Python or R or whatever code they’re using is just the enablement tool to leverage DS in their respective industries / use cases.

However, most BI/ analytics roles would be sufficient using SQL. I do want to differentiate between BI and analytics though. A lot of BI roles are very heavy on reporting and standardizing of data collection, but low on insights. Many BI analysts get burned out / tired of their jobs because they receive very little credit for their hard work (the business owners do). Analysts with insight heavy work is typically more interesting as you own the delivery of the findings. Again, Tableau is just an enablement tool in this job function. It depends from company to company if they use it, but if you can build standardized or automated dashboards with excel and SQL, that should be sufficient.

I don't really know a ""platfform"" that do this for you

  
I work in one of the TOP 4 holding groups talking about advertising. I work in Research &amp; Analytics team, where we do market research and analytics for our clients, here are some products that you could maybe try to do in your agency:

1. Econometric models: what about analyzing and predicting the media spent vs sales of awareness for your clients. You could also optimize their budgets to maximize their results based on your model, or models.
2. Text mining: go beyond Sysomos, Crimson, Meltwater, etc. Try to cluster the audiences on internet, go into a brand's social media and analyze their audiences, how they talk with them? What are their ""sentiments"" from social media? What clusters or groups could be identified from social media? What words works better when it's about launching a new product, or something like that...
3. Geoanalytics: today with programmatic, you can know where your client's audience is answering to advertising efforts. Go and graphic this... Tableay, PowerBI, even R-Shiny are good tools to do it.
4. Pre and post ad tests: your client would be rebranding soon? You could test their new campaign before it launch. Create and survey and deploy it online to know the answers from the client's target, also you can do this after the campaign was launched, so you could compare before vs after and the impact that your agency does.

These are some of the products and also a little ideas that I think you could try to do in your agency.

That&amp;#39;s where a mix of those skills are required, both data analysis and also the engineering pipeline required to make that analysis work. If you&amp;#39;re on a small or brand new team there either isn&amp;#39;t dedicated data engineer, or the DE they do have is overloaded with work and would really appreciate that you can work without draining further resources from them.

My mother-in-law works specifically on the Online Master's programs at Johns Hopkins Carey Business School based here in Baltimore, Maryland, and I have about 10-years of experience in the field of Database Marketing/Digital Marketing/Marketing Analytics. I've been the Head of Digital Marketing for Groupon's (previous) food delivery service (OrderUp, which was also HQ'd here in Baltimore) and I've played with literally petabytes of data.


So with all that background about me out of the way, let's pivot back to your query. A couple things to keep in mind:


1.) Higher-learning EDU is expensive (JHUCBS is one of the more expensive schools for sure)

2.) Online learning requires a lot of discipline



So basically, you wanna get into Data Science and it sounds like you have the money but you want some extra opinions, so let me share mine.

Everything you can learn at JHU can be self-taught for free online. Period. You don't need a Master's or even a Bachelor's to be a data scientist -- it requires literally 0 formal education whatsoever.

So if you wanna spend all that money, go for it! It would be an incredible thing to have on your resume... an MBA from JHU in Data Science... what could be better right?

But I'm also here to tell you that the degree is utter bullshit. Sure, you will absolutely learn a lot about a lot of things, but depending on how old you are, I'd say you probably won't apply about 70% of what you learn from this program in real life scenarios. And I'm 100% certain and confident about my stance and opinion on this.

It's ultimately up to you, but here's what I would learn right now if I were you (in this chronological order):

1.) SQL
2.) Python
3.) Data Analytics

Learn how to mine and organize raw data first with SQL; automated your reporting and data protocols with Python; then learn how to analyze the data you just pulled so you can share with people who make $250k/yr salaries and rely on your for this information so they can make intelligent business decisions.

Keep in mind though that if you become a data scientist, you aren't necessarily an analyst -- you're a code monkey for at least your first 5-years. If business people think you're smart enough, they'll invite you to sit at their table. If not, you're stuck as a code monkey.

I could go on and on because I've been doing this for so long, so feel free to shoot me a DM :)

When it comes to online programs, JHU is both rigorous and expensive.  The primary reason I'm doing my masters is because my employer gives 100% compensation and is supportive of my student schedule. 

A degree in Data Science itself can be a mixed bag. As a major, it's relatively new.  Ideally you'll know more about Programming than a Statistician, more about Stats than a Programmer, and be more technical/quantitative than someone with an someone with a degree in Business Analytics. 

Going the DS route as opposed to an MBSA or MSCS  might pigeonhole you a bit because the degree might be perceived as more narrow in scope.  Someone with an MSBA could become a Data Scientist but then go on to the business side of Analytics, and someone with an MSCS could transition to a different field more easily (such as Software Development or Cybersecurity).  If you paired this degree with say an MBA or graduate certificate in something another field (like software or life sciences), you'll be able to expand career options. 

TLDR:
Accept if you

1. Have the time

2. Have the funding

3. Know you are deadset in the Sciencey side of Analytics","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;The school has an excellent reputation is many fields (Healthcare, National Security, Life Sciences, etc), all of which have a great need for people in Analytics. The alumni network and prestige should mitigate any concerns you might have about finding a job. (Given that you&amp;#39;ve got the skills for it)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When it comes to online programs, JHU is both rigorous and expensive.  The primary reason I&amp;#39;m doing my masters is because my employer gives 100% compensation and is supportive of my student schedule. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A degree in Data Science itself can be a mixed bag. As a major, it&amp;#39;s relatively new.  Ideally you&amp;#39;ll know more about Programming than a Statistician, more about Stats than a Programmer, and be more technical/quantitative than someone with an someone with a degree in Business Analytics. &lt;/p&gt;

1,fpsdzy7,Tender_Figs,1,t2_3uoce3bn,"I can answer this as I have lived the life you have described while trying to become an analytics professional during an era where it wasn't in vogue. Here's my take with 10 years of experience:  


Public accounting is an old ""industry"" so to speak, or business model. It attracts those who are more traditional and conservative, which plays directly into why most people major in accounting. The other type of people, IMHO, are those that loved managerial and ""analytical accounting"" or FP&amp;A. 

I started off in public accounting, was fired from BKD after 9 months, and joined a smaller local firm that was just as bad. They wanted nothing new, no analytical skills, nothing. You were there to churn out a product (audit/returns) and that was it. Your industry knowledge or exposure only came after YEARS of grinding, which I thought was absolute horseshit if you knew what you wanted to do - my specialty at the time was healthcare.

INDUSTRY will be similar varying greatly on your manager - if you wish to stay in accounting. I was always accounting's SQL guy who knew metrics and forecasting. After two controllership positions, I decided this ish is not for me. That's when I dug deep into analytics, BI, SQL, Tableau, Qlik, data modeling, etc. I can tell you that having the business acumen to understand how to model the analysis or the dashboard/database is INVALUABLE. If you could couple that business acumen with the analytical chops and perhaps even more quantitative ability, you are going to be very influential and sought after (mind you, communication skills are just as important as is temperament).

I would use your accounting undergrad combined with a very quantitative specialty. Business analytics is kind of... trade schooly and gimmicky for those who can't handle the math (also, varying on the program, some are ridiculously quantitative).

I would avoid public accounting at all costs if you are certain you would find data analysis/business intelligence/analytics the path meant for you - if I could go back, I would have avoided that ish all together and gone straight into a BI role at a F500 or a hospital system (Baylor is in my backyard).

Now, understand there is something that alluded me back in the day - there are more accounting jobs than most other jobs because they are lower paid and people don't really want to do them. Accounting is making itself ripe for automation as soon as someone can understand the CPA mindset in programmable terms. BI/Analytics jobs will be a tad bit more competitive, so if you communicate well and can show you're logical/technical/likeable, you shouldn't have a problem. In public accounting, you're losing your soul and your brain.

1,fptxj5n,RNGGenius,1,t2_4dhxvvjr,"My standpoint as someone in their mid-20s who sold 3 years of their life to Big 4 Audit to get their CPA but always wanted to do Analytics - GTFO of accounting and never look back lol. Obviously I'm very biased but if you're already thinking about leaving accounting then it's the beginning of the end - only going downhill from here.

For me, I was very deep into accounting so I decided to complete my CPA before moving into FP&amp;A (Financial Planning and Analysis), which sounds cool but it's basically an Excel monkey job. Got lucky and connected with a startup in my city and moonlighted for a couple months before they hired me full-time as a Data Analyst doing BI / Analytics in Power BI mostly.

That being said, I did gain really good experience, work ethic and communication skills from my time in accounting. It really helped me to explain data and how to manage expectations with users and managers, ""so what"" and ""why"" is as important if not more important than the ""what"" hey I created this dashboard or model. 

If you're coming from a business background and you want to do Data Analyst or Data Science work you have to be prepared to learn a lot on your own! (start with SQL and a BI tool such as Power BI then maybe R or Python if you're ever working with huge data sets / parsing data / implementing predictive models). Expecting to learn everything from a Master's of Analytics degree is setting you up for failure - yes it will help and networking would be great (depends on the school) but you have to grab this by the balls and have self-discipline to learn and ask questions. Good news is that you're young and school has taught you how to learn (hopefully).

More and more these Analytics roles have a higher bar to get into the field and people expect you to have a strong quantitative background (accounting isn't one) - but other accounting majors have broken in so why can't you?

From a personal standpoint, the work in Analytics is so much more interesting than accounting which is very tedious. Nobody can predict the future but regardless of what ""career path"" you choose to follow just remember that understanding the business context and why you're doing something is as important as ""knowing what to do"" by coding or creating a model. Most of the time you figure shit out by Googling or StackedOverflow.

This also puts hiring people at ease when it comes to your percieved lack of confidence. 

2) The lack of confidence due to your speech impediment is sugar coated discrimination. But since you asked about getting hired not pursuing a law suit, here's my advice. 

Created canned STAR responses and canned personal stories. There are a bazillion canned questions on the internet. Most interviewers arent as revolutionary as they'd like to believe.

Practice telling your different stories (STAR or CAR method) in different ways (thing 5 main themes/situations told up to 4 different ways) Take your time, slow down to enunciate. Yes it may sound rehearsed. Who cares? Interviews are BS. Look at yourself in the mirror. Practice ad nauseam. Do a mock interview with friends of colleagues and use the stories. Get their feedback. Practice some more. Video yourself saying your stories. 

Bonus points if you bring up overcoming your speech impediment in your masters program or in a professional setting. 

Boom. Get the job.","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;So I would say you&amp;#39;re very qualified for junior and probably even mid level positions. Other people have given good advice about how to keep your skills sharp so I will go a different route. &lt;/p&gt;

One thing I'd add: I would recommend approaching any individual who is doing a kind of job you'd aspire to do in a few years (or even a decade or two), and telling them your situation and what you're hoping to achieve. Ask them for a quick call of say 30 minutes just for a bit of guidance.

Make it clear you'd be very grateful for their time.

I've approached about half a dozen people like this over the years. Only one has said no. Most people enjoy being helpful.

It'll help you get an idea on what specifically you might want to work on. You'll build your network. And at the end of it they may even ask for your CV or hire you!

Not a lot of people do this, but it leads to incredibly valuable conversations. I literally had one *yesterday* and I have about a decade of work experience already (I'm just looking to specialize more so talked to a specialist doing what I might like to do).

When you land the call, be prepared with some specific questions (like you have here), make sure you know about them and their business, and don't let the call drag on (ideally, be the one to end it).

2,fpo6rib,HAL9000000,2,t2_a7pes,"Perhaps you're not interested in a contract job, but if you are feeling like you'll take anything, you should look into contracting jobs. Contact a recruiting agency -- they will have companies ask them for qualified candidates for jobs (like data analyst) and then they'll connect you with the company to see if you're interested in the position. It's not an ideal situation but, based on your frustration, you might want to consider it.

The thing about contract jobs is that companies see these as lower risk for them than if they hire you full time as a direct hire. This means the company is likely more willing to give you a chance if you're being considered as a contractor compared to people applying to them directly for a permanent position. For you, this means you may be more likely to be hired in any given position you apply for (assuming you are qualified) as a contractor.

I'll warn you that contract work can be shitty -- you might be given shitty responsibilities and you may not feel as respected as full time workers. But these jobs can pay decent and give you a paycheck while you're looking for something better. Sometimes contract jobs also can be temporarily contract jobs and then transition to direct hire, working for the company.

Speaking from experience, I went through a lot of time doing interviews and not getting hired for the jobs I wanted. I didn't understand how employment agencies work (they are also sometimes called temp agencies or employment agencies or other things like this). When I finally did connect with an employment agency, they found me a decent contract job within less than a month.

The other thing to understand about employment agencies is that when you apply directly to these jobs, you are competing against people who are applying through employment agencies. So here's /u/keyboard1ish and he's applying for a full time job with benefits. And then here's John/Jane Doe from the recruitment agency applying for the same position, and he's not asking the company for benefits. The hiring company pays his/her employment agency and the employment agency pays the contractor. They might also get benefits through the employment agency, although they'll probably have to pay for those benefits (although it's not terribly expensive for basic healthcare coverage).

So, guess who the hiring company is more likely to hire? They'll hire the guy/girl from the employment agency who they don't have to pay benefits to and who may also ask for less money instead of you.

I'm not saying I know for a fact that you're competing against these types of contractors for every job, because every company doesn't necessarily look for contractors for every job. And in some cases, recruiters will help candidates find jobs that are full time, direct hire to the company, so in some cases you're just competing against other people like this from employment agencies who are also looking to be directly hired (so at least you're not always competing with someone who expects less pay/benefits).  But still.... recruiters are constantly looking at job postings and they have a database of candidates with certain qualifications who are potentially qualified for certain jobs, and they will contact those candidates and help them submit their resumes to the companies. And it's difficult for you to compete with those candidates when you're the only person searching for positions for you.","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps you&amp;#39;re not interested in a contract job, but if you are feeling like you&amp;#39;ll take anything, you should look into contracting jobs.

2,fohwv28,thisisntarjay,2,t2_6fu8n,"Monster Insights appears to be a WordPress plugin that lets you look at Google Analytics data in your WordPress Dashboard. 

&gt; Is there anyway to fix this bug and have back the normal BR stats on analytics while still using MI?

Of course there is. How does your coding capability look?

The answer here is that you DIY, you pay a developer/analytics professional to set you up with a real installation, or you take the free option and get what you get. 

In this case, the free option appears to be nothing more than a reporting dashboard that is breaking your data. Seems like the obvious choice is to pick a different one. 

&gt;  I use it for tracking links from my website to my client's, like I said, something crucial for me.

Monster Insight doesn't appear to actually do anything other than render GA Reports in your WordPress Dashboard, so you aren't using it for tracking links. You're using it as a convenience item so you don't have to log in to GA to see the exact same reports. You're actually using GA to track your links. Monster Insights is just an unnecessary middleman. 

Personally I'd recommend just deleting the plugin and looking at GA, which is the actual source here. 

If you want to tell me your link tracking use case here I'll even explain how you would track whatever you want to track, but again you're going to either need GTM and familiarity with that system or coding knowledge to execute my spec.","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Monster Insights appears to be a WordPress plugin that lets you look at Google Analytics data in your WordPress Dashboard. &lt;/p&gt;

Agree with a comment above that your tool should come last or may not even need more than excel.&lt;/p&gt;

OP, a lot of students just lost their summer internships (I being among them) and a lot of students want real world projects to build out their experience, so there'd absolutely be a demand for analysts to work with you. If you do go down that road, you can pick what ideas you want them to solve while also receiving ideas from them about what they'd recommend. 

Some of the questions you asked are asking big questions that will require large projects, but I also suspect there's a lot of room for little improvements that can be made relatively quickly (ex: maybe the results show you can save $100 a month by buying salad in a smarter way).","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pulled from another comment:&lt;/p&gt;

So if someone clicked on an ad up to 6 months ago, and then went to their web browser and typed in your URL, the credit will still go to CPC. So entirely possible someone came last month from CPC, and returned this month and made a purchase.

Contrast that with the Google Ads interface, which will show you credit for the purchase/conversion on the day that the ad was clicked. So in this case if they returned this month, Google Ads would show that conversion tied to last month's ad click.

In Google Analytics, this is called last non-direct click attribution. So if I visited last month from Google Ads, and then again via Direct, Ads gets the credit. If I visited last month via Ads, then at some point came in from a Google organic search, then came back a week later and made a purchase... that would be attributed to the Organic search, as that was the last known traffic source.

Analytics is certainly a broad topic. However you'll probably specialise in a few areas, even if you're the only analyst at a company. If possible, tie yourself to revenue or savings where possible as that will make it easier to get a raise or sell yourself in another interview.

Statistics is definitely more relevant than pure maths for analytics. 95% of the pure maths that I do is add/subtract/multiply/divide (percentage difference, while being covered by this is something that a lot of non analyst professionals struggle with).

From my perspective, if you can use your qualitative understanding of distributions to investigate the distributions that you'll be working with, you can make assumptions that will simplify your work and support your reporting.

I would like to say that being female wouldn't make a difference, however I really don't know. Companies with a good culture should be open and the interviews should be a level playing field. I hope that you find this to be the case.

I would focus any masters on the progression path you want to take. If you want to be a senior analyst or head of an insights team, the statistics would probably be your best bet. If you want to go down the data science path, the data science would give you the biggest head start in learning that.

I wouldn't worry about wasting time. Starting work a year later won't make much difference over the long run. For me it would come down to the reasons I have for wanting to study more Vs wanting to get money in the short term.

2,fnwd7jp,tbcboo,2,t2_5mruh7zo,"Coming from someone who has a BA in Accounting (High tier Public School, not WGU) back in 2015 I personally had an easy time getting a job, but plenty of people in my same cohort/class with even better grades than me struggled for months. I really dove into the networking aspect of things which allowed me to get paid internships leading to full time employment. Road I'm taking here is that the name of the school doesn't always matter, its timing and I think networking plays a huge role for your 1st job related to a degree; at least in some fields.

I originally started on the CPA and passed two sections back in 2016, but soon realized after being an accountant, that while I loved numbers I would rather be more a Data Analyst/Engineer aka more into Analytics like what your WGU degree is talking about. I'm now more on the tech side myself which just happened by chance.  **So with that...what's your goal?** *If you want to be a straight up Accountant, then sure go for the CPA. Otherwise if you are looking into a role like a Data/Systems Analyst/Engineer then forget that. Trust me, CPA is not of use in that field much...coming from someone with a background in both fields.* ***With the stay at home orders and all this social distancing, I say for $4K, totally get your MSDA at WGU.*** More education surely won't hurt, but make sure to keep applying to jobs while studying if you do.

Fast forward to now and I'm enrolled in WGU's MBA program currently as of April 1st with 6 classes done out of 11 already in less than 3 weeks and I'm working 10-12 hours per day at a top tech company. The MBA for me is mostly a checkbox as I'm moving quickly up the career ladder already and also over the last couple years I've already moved more toward the tech side (I guess you could say more data analytics). I plan to do the WGU Masters in Data Analytics as well just to have that on my belt.  As a side note, my company is paying for the MBA in full and will also pay for the MSDA, and I actually love to learn, its not purely for the checkbox. Just because I use those tools daily, I might know the practical use of them but not all the deeper theories behind them.

I’ve found there to be two main things to prove value in analytics: driving efficiencies, and enabling work. The goal for analytics is to be the competitive advantage for the marketing guys. This is why there is and always will be huge opportunities here. We’re the arms dealers for digital marketing.

A simple way of doing this is dashboarding. E.g. one assistant needs one day a week (8 hours) to build reports, and this might cost the company $100. A dashboard might take 20 hours to scope, build, QA and document ($250) but it will be automated from then on. Boom, after two and a half weeks of the dashboard being live, you’ve saved the company $100 a week.
P.s. in reality you might scope in cost for ongoing maintenance as well.

Another is taking advantage of your tech platforms media efficiency capabilities. For Google this might be building high-intent audiences in GA or CM for the marketing teams to retarget in their campaigns. The efficiency driven is your value.

Enabling work revolves around implementing/troubleshooting/updating tagging infrastructure so that the marketing teams have feedback on their work, or can build audiences. This doesn’t directly drive value but is needed to carry out before pretty much any marketing campaign can go live. Think software engineers: direct value is hard to define from simply building code to but their work is valued in that its required before anything can start.

Finally, being the analytics function, you are the source of truth. This isn’t exactly the most popular position to be in, especially with the mess that is digital measurement and attribution. But it does put you in a position of authority and thought leadership. Your consultation has value.

I have two tips for someone new to analytics.
The first is to get involved in your measurement community (measure slack is a good one, and web analytics Wednesdays/measurecamp if you live near a city). Keeping up to date on tech is much easier and way more fun with people that are excited to share the news.

The second one is surprising to most, but it is so crucial. Get your communication skills up. Even higher than the marketing guys. Explaining technicalities in layman’s terms is a crucial part of the job, and god is it difficult. As soon as marketing people hear ‘analytics’ their eyes glaze over. All concept of value is lost unless you have the ability to boil down the technicalities to relatable concepts. But if you can do this... you’re on your way to becoming a unicorn.

At the end of the day, however, if you feel like analytics isn’t you, it provides a great foundation for any other digital marketing specialisation since you get exposure to all the channels.","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Media agency analytics guy here.&lt;/p&gt;

Data is only as good and useful if it’s accurate. Marketers need this accuracy to measure against benchmarks and goals. It’s a bit tedious reworking data again and again if data collection wasn’t set up properly, naming conventions have changed creating fractures, if APIs don’t mesh well with your data dashboard then data goes missing (therefore making data inaccurate) — even typing this out makes me exhausted. So many things can go wrong on a technical level. And it’s *very technical*.

&lt;p&gt;Separately, I&amp;#39;d agree with others. Google Analytics has a good intro path that I would lean on. YouTube is also very helpful in up-leveling skills. You can also sign up for the free trial of LinkedIn Learning which has some good courses. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Best of luck!&lt;/p&gt;

Hi,  
**1.** As for your first answer, Google Analytics doesn’t report unique users, so for that, you can take new users as **“unique users.”** For this, you can navigate through:  
Audience &gt; Behaviour &gt; New vs Returning users.  
You can find all your new users i.e., unique users here.  
**2.** As for your second answer for this, you can navigate through:  
Audience &gt; Behaviour &gt; New vs Returning users. And, here you can find your returning users as well.

**3.** As for your third answer, discrepancy in data may be caused due to the following factors:  
\- sampling of data  
\- the export happens from the Google Bigquery, so the presented data could vary in CSV from that present in the Analytics Dashboard.

I would like to jump in with a question!

I've been doing Google Analytics for 3 years. Does it make sense for me to learn R and Python and use it for Google Analytics? I understand statistical computation. I'd like to know how deep, useful, and powerful it can be when combined with Google Analytics analysis.

I was thinking of learning them because I'm curious (and bored haha) and I'd like to know if it's a natural step for a Web Analyst. But my career at the moment doesn't call for their usefulness.

Thanks.","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Great post!&lt;/p&gt;

Then use the programming language you choose as much as you can to answer the question. When I first started learning R I would download a dataset to Excel and then open RStudio.

2,fn91idv,cedcommerce,2,t2_qj5s5,"Hi,  
If you want to track your button clicks on **""let’s get started""** you can easily do it by Google Tag Manager by setting up a trigger at your Button Click. On the other hand, if you want to track your traffic across similar multiple domains, it can be through **Cross-Domain Tracking.**  
When you have multiple similar domains and you want to track them then you should go for **Cross-Domain Tracking**, i.e, a single Google Analytics property should be set up. You need to first install the same analytics code in both your domains and make the cookie of both the domains the same which can be done through Google Tag Manager because each domain makes a different cookie, even if they have the same UA ID. And cookies make a unique **Client ID** for a unique website. So, it’s important to make the cookies of both domains the same.

In order to set up this follow the given steps:   
**Step 1:** Open Google Tag Manager.   
**Step 2:** Navigate to “Variables” present on the left side.  
**Step 3:** Under “User-Defined Variables,” click on NEW. (You can find this downwards)  
**Step 4:** Choose the variable type as **“Google Analytics Settings”** under utilities.  
**Step 5:** Once you are in the variable you can see that you have an “auto” cookie domain which is a standard cookie tracking for all Analytics accounts, what you need to do is to adjust your cookie domain setting by changing your main domain’s name**.**  
**Step 6:** Then enter the analytics ID under **Tracking ID.**  
**Step 7:** Enter your cookie domain.  
**Step 8:** Navigate through the drop-down menu of **More Settings.**  
**Step 9:** Under **“**Cross-Domain Tracking,” enter both of your domains separating them with a comma (,)  
**Step 10:**  Save the changes to enable the process with a name.  
**Step 11:** Use this above-made variable in the “tag” of your Google Analytics.  
**Step 12:** Now exclude all linked domains from **“Referral Exclusion List,”** which you can find in “Property Settings” under “Tracking Info.” And list both linked domains.

**And you are done !!**  
Thank You,  
Hope this is helpful.","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi,&lt;br/&gt;

When you have multiple similar domains and you want to track them then you should go for &lt;strong&gt;Cross-Domain Tracking&lt;/strong&gt;, i.e, a single Google Analytics property should be set up. You need to first install the same analytics code in both your domains and make the cookie of both the domains the same which can be done through Google Tag Manager because each domain makes a different cookie, even if they have the same UA ID. And cookies make a unique &lt;strong&gt;Client ID&lt;/strong&gt; for a unique website. So, it’s important to make the cookies of both domains the same.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to set up this follow the given steps:&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Step 1:&lt;/strong&gt; Open Google Tag Manager.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Step 2:&lt;/strong&gt; Navigate to “Variables” present on the left side.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Step 3:&lt;/strong&gt; Under “User-Defined Variables,” click on NEW. (You can find this downwards)&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Step 4:&lt;/strong&gt; Choose the variable type as &lt;strong&gt;“Google Analytics Settings”&lt;/strong&gt; under utilities.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Step 5:&lt;/strong&gt; Once you are in the variable you can see that you have an “auto” cookie domain which is a standard cookie tracking for all Analytics accounts, what you need to do is to adjust your cookie domain setting by changing your main domain’s name&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Step 6:&lt;/strong&gt; Then enter the analytics ID under &lt;strong&gt;Tracking ID.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Step 7:&lt;/strong&gt; Enter your cookie domain.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Step 8:&lt;/strong&gt; Navigate through the drop-down menu of &lt;strong&gt;More Settings.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Step 9:&lt;/strong&gt; Under &lt;strong&gt;“&lt;/strong&gt;Cross-Domain Tracking,” enter both of your domains separating them with a comma (,)&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Step 10:&lt;/strong&gt;  Save the changes to enable the process with a name.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Step 11:&lt;/strong&gt; Use this above-made variable in the “tag” of your Google Analytics.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Step 12:&lt;/strong&gt; Now exclude all linked domains from &lt;strong&gt;“Referral Exclusion List,”&lt;/strong&gt; which you can find in “Property Settings” under “Tracking Info.” And list both linked domains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And you are done !!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Thank You,&lt;br/&gt;

\-Can they explain how the web browser works? Too technical but it can be used to filter candidates.

\-They also need to know how to use Google Tag Manager. They can differentiate Variables, Triggers, and Tags.

\-This might be unusual but ask them what are the limitations of Google Analytics.

Soft skills

\-Ask them how they navigate through the politics. If managers ask ""these numbers aren't right"", how do they respond?

Hi,   
When you have multiple similar domains and you want to track them then you should go for **Cross-Domain Tracking**, i.e, a single Google Analytics property should be set up. You need to first install the same analytics code in both your domains and make the cookie of both the domains same which can be done through Google Tag Manager because each domain makes a different cookie, even if they have the same UA ID. And cookies make a unique **Client ID** for a unique website. So, it’s important to make the cookies of both domains the same.

In order to set up this follow the given steps:   
**Step 1:** Open Google Tag Manager.   
**Step 2:** Navigate to “Variables” present on the left side.  
**Step 3:** Under “User-Defined Variables,” click on NEW. (You can find this downwards)  
**Step 4:** Choose the variable type as **“Google Analytics Settings”** under utilities.  
**Step 5:** Once you are in the variable you can see that you have an “auto” cookie domain which is a standard cookie tracking for all Analytics accounts, what you need to do is to adjust your cookie domain setting by changing your main domain’s name**.**  
**Step 6:** Then enter the analytics ID under **Tracking ID.**  
**Step 7:** Enter your cookie domain.  
**Step 8:** Navigate through the drop-down menu of **More Settings.**  
**Step 9:** Under **“**Cross-Domain Tracking,” enter both of your domains separating them with a comma (,)  
**Step 10:**  Save the changes to enable the process with a name.  
**Step 11:** Use this above-made variable in the “tag” of your Google Analytics.  
**Step 12:** Now exclude all linked domains from **“Referral Exclusion List,”** which you can find in “Property Settings” under “Tracking Info.” And list both linked domains.

**And you are done !!**  
Thank You,  
Hope this is helpful.","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

* Are there are any managers with very different sales targets, or an unusual number of representatives?
* Do any of the sales representatives have unusual targets or unusual achieved sales?

If you see anything weird, think about what metrics would showcase this. Regardless of what you see, I would go a little deeper than your cumulative sales ranking approach as data like this has the potential to be skewed, and it's also very high level. You're looking to deliver insights that generate impact, not just some numbers for your boss to make sense of, so the closer you can get to finalized conclusions, the more value you're providing your company.

Back to the data itself, imagine that one of the managers had a single really bad quarter, but the rest of the time is a high achiever. Should the manager be penalized for that? Also, what if a manager has a low performing sales representative on their team of generally high performers. How can this be accounted for? I would think about 2 sets of metrics, one for the reps and one for the managers.

* For the reps, I'd be interested to know the average of their sales achieved divided by sales target. This is basically using each quarter's performance as an observation to create a sales rep performance metric. This will also reduce the impact of a ""down"" quarter for an otherwise good performer, or an unusually good quarter for a poor performer.
* For the managers, I'd be interested to see not just the sales achieved, but something about the team breakdown and overall sales generated. So if manager A has 10 employees, 8 of them consistently hit their numbers but 2 of them never do, how can that be surfaced relative to manager B, with one outstanding performer and 3 lackluster ones? Maybe something conceptually like an interquartile range; for each manager, what's the average performance of their bottom, middle, and top reps.
* A way of showing the overall impact of the managers would also be useful. So for example, if manager A is hitting 80% of his $10 million quarterly target, and manager B is hitting 95% of his $1M target, it's may not be fair to say manager B is doing better.

My final thought would be around asking how the company could use this information. Does the company need to know which managers are contributing the most or who is most necessary? Is the company trying to understand quarterly sales performance? Or is this just for ranking managers and reps for something like bonuses and promotions? Try to consider how the data you create will be used and work backwards from what is trying to be understood.","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not sure how deep you want to go here, but I think the first thing you want to do is read through the actual data and look for outliers or anything that sticks out as unusual.

I recently graduated with an economics degree in December and I’m trying to transition into the analytics field, however I haven’t had much success landing a job in the field and am looking into further education.

So I’m here seeking advice as to my next move. Should I aim to seek acceptance into a Masters program and possibly take remedial classes (my current plan: local university offers dual MS/MBA that I am applying to), or would it be better to enroll in  some online learning courses before applying, or to just get an online certificate? Will a company be willing to hire me with just a certificate alone?

I made it to the third round of the interview process for an analytics job (marketing analytics, i.e. using big data from customer online interactions to generate more credible leads).

I'm currently wrapping up my Master's degree in Mechanical Engineering this semester and no longer see or want a long term career in this field (mostly due to job availability and location). I have about 5 years of experience in consumer product design ranging from product design firms to Fortune 500 companies. 

At my last co-op, I was in more of a program management role and  used Power BI a bit for creating dashboards for sales data and also wrote a few process automation scripts in Python for the connected product I owned. I've began putting more time towards developing skills to transition out of engineering as a career this last semester of grad school. I know how to use Power BI and am also proficient in Python and SQL so that leads me to believe I possess the basic skills for an entry level data analyst position. 

I'd like to hear some advice in regards to what I can do resume or portfolio wise to make myself more marketable for entry level data analyst roles, considering I don't have much formal experience aside from creating dashboards at my last co-op.

For immigration purposes though, I will say it's very important you do that as a career and not side-gigs.

With an economics + MBA, and skills in business analysis, it wont be too difficult to find an analyst role. You can focus on a niche and spend a few months building skills on that and building a portfolio of sample projects.

A bit of research will find you the different pathways, but briefly, you can go into either the very technical side (using R, Python, etc for data science) or more business-side like data visualisation in Tableu, PowerBI, some R/Python, etc... I think the latter is more suited to your business education.

Once you have the skills, start building some sample projects from public datasets. You can find them on places like Kaggle or many countries publish their public datasets (e.g. ONS in the UK). You might be able to move into this within your current employer, if you show you have picked new skills and want to switch roles.","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes you can become a business analyst by picking up skills on the side, considering you have a degree in Economics already.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For immigration purposes though, I will say it&amp;#39;s very important you do that as a career and not side-gigs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With an economics + MBA, and skills in business analysis, it wont be too difficult to find an analyst role. You can focus on a niche and spend a few months building skills on that and building a portfolio of sample projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A bit of research will find you the different pathways, but briefly, you can go into either the very technical side (using R, Python, etc for data science) or more business-side like data visualisation in Tableu, PowerBI, some R/Python, etc... I think the latter is more suited to your business education.&lt;/p&gt;

1) How does this compare? Compare against different industries, different cohorts, or segments.  Compare against hypotheses or predictions.  Compare against different time lengths: Year over year, month over month. Decades even. Compare it to different countries, cultures, religions.

2) Follow tangents, Pull on threads: Look for similar insights from around the world. Did someone else look at this in a slightly different angle? Where did they base their insights? go deep into a rabbit hole and look at how others Look for holes in data sets that exist. where can you get that missing data? 

3) Ask Your Idols: If you find great insights, email the person who wrote it. Ask them to jump on a call, or answer a few questions by email.  Tweet at people. Share their insights then ask them about it.  Why did they do it? When? How?   I constantly do this because I run a newsletter that I share great insights from like 10 to 20 people each week.

4) Don't Re-invent The Wheel:   Can you put two different insights together in a new way? Keep reading. Perhaps keep a swipe file of your favorite insights from around the world.  After a hundred, sort them, categorize them, tag them. See if you can find anything interesting.

Struggling with what to write and coming up with a hypothesis in theory should not be hard because you are given the exact conditions for what you need to write about - going back on your post history, it sounds like you're part of advertising:

- You have a hard metric given to you; this in itself is a finding that you need to ultimately *analyze* as part of your job. Before you delve into a hypothesis, you need to think about what could possibly be linked to this metric. 
- For example: you wake up and see that the ground is wet - what are the possible scenarios that could have made this happen? Did it rain? Was it due to sprinklers? Was someone hosing down the street? 
- Given you are in digital analytics, you should be able to refer to measurement. ""I have a vase outside. Let's check to see if that has filled up."" or ""Let me check to see if everyone else's lawns are wet"" or ""Let me look at another street to see if that's wet as well""

- Ultimately, pointing out that the street is wet doesn't really help anyone or tell a story. Anyone else on your street would be able to see the same thing, but it's your job as an analyst to develop that story based off evidence and insight that lets you take action.
- Let's say you conclude that it's raining (and you don't watch weather reports). Does this mean there is a storm coming or the next few days will be wet?

Finally, she’s also going to give you data around how often she met with the prospects and how often she stayed the night.

Now you likely have enough data to help her minimize her efforts.

The answer perspective you are looking for may be different for different individuals. Being in the profession of analytics, I would rather do my analysis on the basis of the following:  
1. It totally depends on the type of post i.e media used such as photos, videos or content (if content the quality of the content, writing skills, subject, etc.)  
2. On the basis of the above perspective, I would then try and analyze what type of users it may actually catch and attract.  
3. Then comes the part where I will segment my users into categories I think could attract and actually analyze it with the types of users who actually liked the post.  
4. I will be then comparing it with similar posts and try to find where it did set the standards in comparison to the other similar posts.  
5. Then comes the analysis of the type of people who actually liked the post i.e demographics, country they are from, how are they actually engaging like how much time they are spending on the post and a common category of users it actually targetted.  
6. Then I would see how will the post perform on the basis of time i.e short-run and long-run analysis.  
After all the above-given analysis hopefully, I may able to figure out the reason why likes increased.

A Cohort sample is selected which will form the basis of our analysis, assuming the number of overall users hasn't increased drastically i.e. its not an outlier like Coronavirus lock-downs around the world have made people join the platform to keep connected.

Second Calculate consolidated data at user level with # of Logins, Time spent by users, # of activities (likes, comments, shares, pages visited, video seconds viewed, # of posts interacted with, # of new friends or increased interaction with current friend list, etc.) in sessions during each day of our time period.

**Step 1: Setup**
---
Create a ""WHF"" service page. 

On that page, set up a server-side permanent cookie (so that you can prevent ITP and stuff). An anonymous cookie will suffice, such as name: ""internal"" and value: ""yes"".

On the website, read that cookie and set up a user-scoped custom dimension. GTM makes this easy as pie.

Prepare an exclude filter based on that custom dimension.

Be aware that the filter's not gonna work in real time reporting for hits that don't have the custom dimension, but will be filtered in regular reports if the Client ID matched it at least once in the past.

**Step 2: Identifiy people**

If you are in a situation where income is unreliable and cash reserves are very low then this can make sense. You&amp;#39;re paying more overall in interest, but you&amp;#39;ll get flexibility faster. If you&amp;#39;re the kind who&amp;#39;s going to take that flexibility and blow it on cocaine and hookers then flexibility is bad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My interest rates now range from 3.51% - 4.04%. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For personal loans, those all round to the same. Usually what matters is when you&amp;#39;re talking 20% credit cards vs 6% student loans vs 3% auto loans.&lt;/p&gt;

There are a couple of ways to look at this. The old school ETL approach goes something like this:  Take source records and transform them into a Fact using SQL functions to calculate measures such as elapsed time. Build a date dimension. Create an OLAP cube on your Facts &amp; Dimensions. Use Excel or PowerBi to connect to your cube to visualise your data.

If you don't care much about traditional SQL/ETL you can query your transactional system directly using PowerBI and do all of the calcs you want on the fly using DAX.

1,fjelio6,SquareCurvesStudio,1,t2_43rjm8zb,"Hello\~ Sorry, somewhat of a long post, but it's my first analyst interview ever.

Interviewing for a Market Analyst position (my first analyst position woo) in two days and I'm curious to know what to potentially expect in regards to topics that will be covered as far as structure of the interview? As far as technical skills go, I believe my SQL, Excel, and Salesforce Marketing Cloud experience looks really good to them, based on what they said in the phone interview. I'm enrolled in an online data analytics bootcamp and have hands on experience with cleaning, organizing, slicing, and presenting insights from data via Excel, SQL and Tableau. I have some practice projects on GitHub that essentially demonstrates my ability to derive insights in the form of charts, graphs, heat maps, etc in Tableau in regards to regional views of sales data, cross-product analysis, profit/break-even analysis, etc.

My main concern is the topic of KPIs; as I saw that reporting on specific KPIs was a requirement on the job description, I feel like it'll come up in some way/shape/form. So if anything, I'm trying to narrow down what the essential KPIs are for a Market Analyst. As broad is it may seem, I'd like a general gist that I can re-familiarize myself between now and my interview in order to give me a better chance at answering these kinds of questions more efficiently and clearly. I've never really had experience talking about KPIs on the fly and in a conversation. Coming from a Marketing background previously, it's kind of embarrassing. But, tbh I've been more on the admin/excel side of Marketing and never really had to answer KPI questions.

Other than that, if anyone has any other insights that they could share that might give me an edge, that would be much appreciated. Especially if you are in, or have been in a similar role in the food industry. Being that the data analytics field is relatively new to me, I'm asking for all the help I can get in terms of preparation for such a position and its interview process. Like, is there any value in printing some of my tableau projects to bring in and discuss?

If needed here is some brief (vague) info about the company:

It's a restaurant umbrella brand that owns a handful of the most popular fast food chains across the globe. This position feels like it's between an entry-level and a mid-level role.

3,fipdv7b,jarkeb,3,t2_afgeic8,"My uni has many data oriented clubs that a lot of people participate in. They have various hackathons throughout the year as well as weekend workshops occasionally. Informs, travelytics, Business analytics leadership council, data science club, EnVision, Salesforce, etc. The list goes on. I don't actively participate in the clubs since I work full time and am in grad school, but the weekend projects/workshops have been very interesting. Much more so than the standard titanic dataset, or wooldridge problems that you typically cover in class. If you have the opportunity, I'd recommend joining and participating in as many as you can. It'll not only help you network, but also build a portfolio. 

Lastly, go to the career management center and talk to an advisor. Go over everything. Your resume, interviewing tips, mach interviews, etc. They are a very valuable resource that you have access to, and it's free. The interesting thing about college is that until you get an internship or job, you really know maybe .2% of what you need to be successful. Everything else you will learn OTJ. So the internship hiring process is more about selling yourself than your background, skills and qualifications. In the world of data, if you know how to read a library into python, do joins in SQL, use stack exchange, and use pivot tables, then you have the skills for an internship, you just have to sell those skills to the recruiters, which is where the career center comes into play. Sure some people may have a stronger background or more experience, but as long as your resume catches the attention of either the recruiter or the automated system, then it has done it's job and you just have to sell yourself in the interview. 

I wish you the best of luck and try to find projects for things that interest you. It's the best way to learn. For example, I like fitness, so I found a powerlifting dataset that I used to build various predictive models that determine what place a lifter will finish a competition. There are also significant amounts of data available based on player stats in Gran Turismo. I haven't decided what I will do with it yet, but I like video games and so I'm excited to see what insights I can get out of the data. Also in the process of tracking my weight, sleep, exercise, and other metrics, almost obsessively, so that over time I will have enough data to make determinations about how to best reach my fitness goals. People do projects with their personal finance, and with things like NBA stats. I work in banking so I get enough finance in my day to day and could care less about professional sports teams. Nothing would demotivate me more than sitting down to do a project based on final four predictions.

Either way, I would recommend as another person said to head to Kaggle. Stay away from the competitions for now as some of them are pretty advanced. Search for datasets that interest you. Brainstorm what you can do with the data. Start building some plots that explain what's happening in the data. Then if you need more ideas, look at the kernels that others have posted to get inspiration. Again, best of luck. Don't get discouraged.

There are certain things I look for besides the above, like being ""Curious"", ""Find efficient ways of Working"", the ability to dig deeper and really find out what people are asking for, The ability to present your findings back, and give recommendations. If your communication skills are poor then being able to do analysis doesn't always help a business.

Languages/Skills
* If you aren’t completely at ease with advanced SQL you’ll struggle with moving up in an analytics org. As you advance you need to be able to review and teach others. Thankfully most SQL is transferable. Make sure you practice windowing functions, subqueries, joins, and multi-step ETLs.
* Learning a scripting language makes you very valuable, especially to smaller orgs with limited engineering resources. I would strongly recommend Python here. You can use it to automate jobs or do more complex data processing and even DS work.
* Excel is a huge timesaver and will almost certainly be used anywhere you work. Developing deep skills here will pay off throughout your career. That said, VBA is a waste of time and rarely used anymore. Since I left corporate finance to work in tech I haven’t seen it used a single time.

Formal qualification
* If you don’t have an undergraduate degree, I would seriously consider finding a way to get one. Many companies don’t consider anyone without one.
* If that’s not an option, I would focus on your work experience and try to build that up. The #1 experience I look for is people who have generated measurable business impact through their work.
* I’m a hiring manager and in my experience (1000s of resumes, 100s of interviews) I have not seen any value in online-only degrees and certificates.

1,fh8plc7,Moorieuk1,1,t2_1qccnsyt,"For the most part, if your group definition is correct within your custom channel grouping, it's generally instant in my experience. 

There are a few things to check to ensure your CCG is set up correctly and should hopefully begin showing the dat you expect:

1. Channel groups are executed in order within your CCG. If your definition matches elsewhere first with a more broad match then data wont appear in your newly formed group unless you refine it to stop that particular data that should appear in your new group, or alternatively re-order your group within your CCG so that your new group executes first. With that in mind, I suggest checking your definitions to ensure this isn't happening here.

2. Check data isn't appearing in 'Other', if that is the case, it may suggest that the configuration of your group may be the issue.

3. How many conditions does the group contain? It's not uncommon to see a multi condition group where you're matching multiple source/medium etc. Where one of the AND / OR conditions in use is not working in the intended way you expect.

With regards to where you should set this up, that's personal preference. If it's a clients GA property, I'd generally consider a CCG within YOUR personal assets (linked to your account only). You can always promote the CCG once you have confirmed the set up and then itll appear for all users with permissions on the GA property.

Personally, I define the most important channels by importance to the business or client e.g. those that generate the most significant leads/revenue first, to least and test as I define to ensure data is populating the respective groups as required.

Yes, but it's still, at the very least, a Herculean task to drive real (either ground floor or C-Suite) interest in mapping analytics for a few reasons - this is just my two cents, I am often incorrect and am just as likely to be off base here too :)

1. The margins are often so razor-thin that ginning up interest in a .08% profit increase is only really possible at large corporations where that turns into big money
2. After presenting a robust analysis to a 3PL operations team (for example), the team's Sr.  VP asks ""Okay, so what now?""  At least anecdotally, mapping has to be uber-tailored to each business/department's operational workflow in order to have any chance of revealing ""actionable"" insight.  A profitability tool for an Account Manager looks a lot different than the same tool you'd need to create for a Pricing Analyst, or a Freight Coordinator, etc.
   1. It sounds dumb, but the Earth is just the Earth - a map has lost all meaning outside of ""does this qualify for free two-day shipping?""  IMO extracting real value requires that orgs start looking for analysts in this space that more closely represent, say, Lewis &amp; Clark than Stephen Hawking...

tldr; the analysis has to be packaged with the solution, and the solution has to be specifically tailored to your audience, otherwise it'll just look like every other season truckload rate/capacity line chart they're already not using.

Obviously none of us has this figured out, which is why your question is so intriguing, but attached is a sample tool from a previous employer (randomized data as it was used in a local Tableau user group presentation) to get the ball rolling, I suppose.  There is a lot happening on the page, too much actually now that I'm a touch older lol, but if you'd like to know more about the specific functionality and their purposes I'd be happy to discuss.  I'm always trying to learn whatever I can from industry nerds like us and this is a hugely interesting question, so I'll be keeping tabs on the answers that flow through here either way!

&lt;p&gt;Yes, but it&amp;#39;s still, at the very least, a Herculean task to drive real (either ground floor or C-Suite) interest in mapping analytics for a few reasons - this is just my two cents, I am often incorrect and am just as likely to be off base here too :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The margins are often so razor-thin that ginning up interest in a .08% profit increase is only really possible at large corporations where that turns into big money&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After presenting a robust analysis to a 3PL operations team (for example), the team&amp;#39;s Sr.  VP asks &amp;quot;Okay, so what now?&amp;quot;  At least anecdotally, mapping has to be uber-tailored to each business/department&amp;#39;s operational workflow in order to have any chance of revealing &amp;quot;actionable&amp;quot; insight.  A profitability tool for an Account Manager looks a lot different than the same tool you&amp;#39;d need to create for a Pricing Analyst, or a Freight Coordinator, etc.

* 60% Cleaning and Prepping data for EDA (Primarily done in Jupyter to leave a paper trail of the work)

All my data prepping and analysis is done in Jupyter notebooks.

I received my bachelor's of science and mathematics and started my career as a math teacher. After only making $32k per year, I decided that I needed to look elsewhere to make ends meat. I left teaching and was able to land an entry-level reporting roll with a benefits administration company. From there, I taught myself to code in a few languages including SQL. With this experience, I was able to get another gig doing data curation and processing. The company recognized my skillset and promoted me to a DBA role in which I am in charge of reporting for the organization. 

I am currently in a MSBA program. I decided to pursue this to fill in some gaps in knowledge. I will say this - most of what I have experienced in the workforce and during my undergrad is more technical than what I'm learning in the MSBA program. The benefit of this program is the exposure to concepts that I would not be able to gain within my current role.

1,fjfgcy4,MindlessTime,1,t2_jqnnc,"TL;DR — The title of Data Scientist is inflated and meaningless. The field will specialize and specializations won’t pay as well. Anyone, anywhere can do the job and it will eventually be outsourced to the lowest bidder.

——

Yes. 100% yes. I’ll be the one to make the cynical argument here.

Everyone and their dog has rebranded themselves as a “data scientist”. Every manager and CEO who doesn’t have any idea how to improve their company is changing “Analyst” titles to “Data Scientist” in order to get smart people in the door who, in theory, will have those ideas for them.

Look, there is valuable work that data scientists do. I’m not saying there isn’t. The work varies and has started to spawn more specific and appropriate job titles. The titles and definitions vary slightly, but I’ll use my own version.

There’s the Machine Learning Engineer — someone who designs and helps implement predictive models to accomplish a specific, predetermined goal and who also maintains the accuracy and usefulness of models currently in production. The tools for this are getting better each day, but there will always be some evaluation and know-how involved. But the job will be less about creating the tools and more about just knowing how to use them — less chef, more line cook. Salaries will adjust accordingly.

There’s the Data Engineer — someone who works with a data user (ML engineer, developer, analyst, etc.) to yank data from one place, clean it, massage it into something a format more useful, then toss it into another system. This is the classic plumber or electrician-type job. That makes it sound simple and menial. But plumbing and electrical maintenance and design are not simple, and neither is Data Engineering. It takes some nuisances understanding of the client or individual or company or need — enough so that this job won’t be fully outsourced. Salaries may fall (or might increase for a short time while cloud computing proliferates). But eventually this will simply be an honorable trade that can be learned at a community college or trade school and applied productively in exchange for a solid, middle-class income.

There’s the BI Developer — the person who creates and maintains tools and dashboards that monitor and report on one thing or another. This position is administrative in nature. People who make decisions need to know things about the world or about their company. BI Developers provide the means to attaining that knowledge. This position existed before “data science” and has benefited from the tools developed during the boom. Current BI Engineers probably won’t see any salary change, but some “data scientists” who do essentially the same thing may see their titles and salaries downgraded to BI Engineer.

Data Analyst — This isn’t really a thing. I say that as someone who has held the title. At best, data analysts are actually statisticians. You find them in marketing where campaign testing requires experimental design and carefully tweezing out the signal from the noise. This position will stick around, though I have no idea what the title or salary will be. Marketing has been pretty fundamentally changed by data science (I.e. intuition doesn’t cut it anymore). But I think they will just take over that profession.

A data analyst, at worst, is just a business analyst. If a manager is too lazy to comb through a directory or dashboards to find and collect a series of metrics and put them in a PowerPoint — that’s a business analyst job. Plenty of “data analysts” do just that. If this is what you do as a “data analyst” while make much more than a business analyst, you’re screwed. You’re absolutely screwed. I don’t care if you know SQL. Analyst SQL is not that hard. Basic computer literacy alone can not justify a six figure salary anywhere.

That said, these people have high visibility and see the sausage making of corporate decisions more than most other positions. There’s a lot of opportunity for data analysts to be noticed and promoted. If you’re a recent college grad who wants to start at the bottom and climb that greasy ladder of corporate advancement—more power to you, friend. Data analyst is a good way into that right now.

Look, I don’t mean to bad mouth data science. It’s gonna be around, in one way or another, whatever we end up calling it. But if you want a job with a guaranteed upper-middle class or upper class income—doctor, lawyer, accountant. They’ve been that for a while because they are domestic industries. A doctor in India can’t check my pulse. Will Data Science be that 30 years from now? Hell no! By definition, the job can be done anywhere. And it will eventually be standardized and the work will flow to the lowest bidder.

Find a niche. Build a brand. Or better yet, save the majority of your gobsmackingly oversized paycheck and retire early.","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;TL;DR — The title of Data Scientist is inflated and meaningless.

The experience is different... be prepared to self teach a lot because the student teacher ratio is rough, and some of the communication resources have kinks that are still being worked out.

However, compared to self teaching in other contexts, this has been much more efficient. You are going into it with:
1. An assurance that what you are learning is useful.
2. A rough outline that you have to fill in the details of for yourself.
3. Demands on your time that force you to sand down rough edges in your knowledge when you may not have the discipline to do so independently.

The internet is a big place and self teaching is hard without the three things above. This is what an online program provides. We all have to self teach, but starting with an outline and context makes it much easier and efficient to do it.

Am I going to go work for Google, Amazon or Facebook after the program? No, I'm not there and may never be. Do I have a better understanding of the scope of Analytics and what I am interested in, and a solid grasp of my foundations and limitations? Absolutely. I know the areas in which I need to continue learning after the program, and the areas I want to continue to explore. And it's not that it isn't paying for itself... I am looking at a job change from a financial analyst to a data engineering role, all because of this degree and the ability it provided me to speak confidently about analytics problems, data and data cleaning and storage technics.

After I finish this, I am probably going to go back for their OMSCS program just because. My employer will pay for it and I like the learning. It has also taught me that I really need to just go take a linear algebra class and all my calculus classes again because you need a very sharp grasp of these. It takes a lot of extra time when you are self teaching these on the fly during simulation or regression, etc.

Oh and it also forces you into team projects with people from much different situations than you are used to on the day to day. You would be surprised what you can learn just from a few conversations with someone who does something completely different from you, and is at a similar skill level in analytics but a much advanced one in their area of expertise.

All of this comes from someone who is good at starting things and bad at finishing them without external deadlines.

I know the areas in which I need to continue learning after the program, and the areas I want to continue to explore. And it&amp;#39;s not that it isn&amp;#39;t paying for itself... I am looking at a job change from a financial analyst to a data engineering role, all because of this degree and the ability it provided me to speak confidently about analytics problems, data and data cleaning and storage technics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After I finish this, I am probably going to go back for their OMSCS program just because. My employer will pay for it and I like the learning. It has also taught me that I really need to just go take a linear algebra class and all my calculus classes again because you need a very sharp grasp of these. It takes a lot of extra time when you are self teaching these on the fly during simulation or regression, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh and it also forces you into team projects with people from much different situations than you are used to on the day to day. You would be surprised what you can learn just from a few conversations with someone who does something completely different from you, and is at a similar skill level in analytics but a much advanced one in their area of expertise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of this comes from someone who is good at starting things and bad at finishing them without external deadlines. So for me, classes, even remote ones, provide me with a structure that forces me to better myself.&lt;/p&gt;

1. It sounds like you are just saying you can outdo Google - which in my mind is like, good luck.
2. ""Using AI"" is an extremely vague term and this means nothing if you were pitching this as a business idea - one because it is a buzzword that people use to juice up a product/service without specifics and not all AI is created equal.

I work for a medium large (500+) omni channel agency with advanced programmatic capabilities and reporting and we know from experience that 95% of display based platforms will have no clicks associated in analytics platforms which are based on last click and clicks in general.

What becomes very necessary in that situation are post view conversions, aka view through... That is anyone who saw and ad, didn't click and later returned through the site... via organic, direct or even paid search.

Ok great, view through isn't terribly new. We're able to do it for any display ad type, ctv/OTT, radio, banners, native, etc. not just banners like some on our platform.

We take it a step further and we also measure the time between first impression and conversion for ""time to convert"" reporting, we can do minutes, hours or most commonly days.

We also deduplicate conversions and report on revenue (or whatever metric) each platform influenced as a percentage.

There are typically plenty of exec-facing meetings, team stand-up/project status meetings, and talking with and training internal customers, etc - I’d say maybe 15-20 hours per week. I spend another few hours  thinking about and planning how the BI function contributes to the company, and working to optimize for that. In all, about 50% of my time goes to more traditional management, and the other 50% goes to IC work, which consists of analysis, building pipelines and dashboards, QA/QC, and writing code.

Research job specs that match your current workload, it'll help give you an idea of any gaps you may have if your aspiring to be a manager. Additionally it'll help you get a better understanding of whats going on outside the office.

Maybe use the opportunity to partner up with someone who compliments your skills, assuming you'll be able to input into the new job spec. Again existing job adverts might be useful here.

Pay isn't everything, if you can manage to get someone decent in to help/manage the work it could be career changing. Decent bosses in this space could have a massive impact on your career path.

Upskilling - have a list of potential training you'd like to do. Automation would be a good one as you'll be able to do more work with the same resource (i.e. You).

Failing that ask for flexible working and overtime. The cost and hassle of on boarding someone is much more than paying someone more for a period.

**Business Analyst**

These guys are generally focused on report generation and KPI (Key Performance Index) metrics. They do a lot of SQL and a bit of Tableau. Most of their work is light on statistics but heavy on visuals.

Our business analysts often report to managers, directors, VP's, and other organizational lynchpins.

---

**Research Analyst**

These guys are invested in the medical side of things. Their work tends to culminate in lengthy Word docs recommending one vendor's product over another. They use SQL, but seem a lot more comfortable getting things into a spreadsheet to run their stats (like chi-squared tests).

Since we're a healthcare joint, our research analysts talk with the IRB (Internal Review Board), the nurses, and the doctors. Their role is to facilitate any research that medical practitioners might want to conduct by supplementing medical know-how with stats know-how.

---

**Data Scientist**

Our company has weak sauce technical skills, so the data scientists are all contractors. They're trained on the standard array of data science tech though; Python, Jupyter, R, Spark (for the big data stuff), etc. The ones we've worked with so far tend to tout ML/AI as their big value adds. 

Data science is new and poorly understood where I work, so our guys tend to work directly with a sponsor (usually a director). Their projects might be something like ""increase success rate of insurance claims by x%"".

Key responsibilities of a data analyst is to use ETL to streamline datasets and their respective visualizations to cross-functional teams. He/She can use any number of platforms to accomplish this task. This can range from Excel,R,Visual Basic,SQL,Tableau,PowerBI etc. 

A higher end-function, based on the hierarchy level, is to build right back function from customized dashboard to the data-warehouse. Meaning stakeholder can directly make inputs to a certain master data by plug and play functions built in the dashboard (but then again the data analyst must also account for version control so that user doesnt send garbage into the warehouse). A more specialized role may also involve forecasting

This can be in form of running cost-center performance analysis,. end-of-month analysis, labor costing, backflush analysis among others

Most of the role comprises of heavy background in economics and statistics. Usually Finance analysts are also IT system superusers for certain finance modules like SAP FICO etc.

**Data Scientists**

People are often confused with Data Scientists and data analysts. Mind you, this guy doesn't do any ETL for other teams but plays with data given by other teams. He/She uses raw data to transpose patterns, forecasts for a specific time-period and presents gainful outputs that will help firms scale in the near future. FYI, all responsibilities mentioned up till now can be done by a data analyst too. And often, most data scientists out there do the exact same thing.

The fun part comes when the role also has designing Neural nets. So after building  the forecasts, the data scientist will often divide data into training and test. Depending upon the level of code, the DS would either build a system that keeps learning with every generation augmenting the forecasts or build a crawler that would scrap through unstructured data from a large set, reduce dimensions and build labels

3,fdoufyv,Derangedteddy,3,t2_19vluyoo,"I would suggest this approach, albeit a bit homegrown:

1.) Define the season.  Do so by determining the time period during which your sales volume exceeds two standard deviations above the mean of the previous quarter.  The season ends when sales return to a level below this threshold, and stays there for a week (holidays must be accounted for as sales will drop on those days and the surrounding days).

2.) Measure your retention rate within the context of this season and the previous season.  

For example:

1.) Statistics reveals that our seasonal sales occur between November 1 and December 31.

2.) In the 2018 season, we started with 1,000 customers on 11/1/2018.

3.) Between the 2018 and 2019 seasons combined, we acquired 350 customers.  

4.) At the end of the 2019 season on 12/31/2019, we had 1,150 customers.

5.) Our retention rate for the holiday season year-over-year is therefore: ((1,150 - 350) / 1,000) X 100 = 80%

This gives you insight into how many dormant customers you're retaining year-over-year during your seasonal swings.  I would apply this same logic to the off-season, and measure that separately using the same methodology.

It's not perfect, but it's better than what you're working with now.  Also be sure to double check that your leadership is ok with this homegrown approach before using it.  I hope this helps.","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I would suggest this approach, albeit a bit homegrown:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1.) Define the season.  Do so by determining the time period during which your sales volume exceeds two standard deviations above the mean of the previous quarter.  The season ends when sales return to a level below this threshold, and stays there for a week (holidays must be accounted for as sales will drop on those days and the surrounding days).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2.) Measure your retention rate within the context of this season and the previous season.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1.) Statistics reveals that our seasonal sales occur between November 1 and December 31.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2.) In the 2018 season, we started with 1,000 customers on 11/1/2018.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3.) Between the 2018 and 2019 seasons combined, we acquired 350 customers.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4.) At the end of the 2019 season on 12/31/2019, we had 1,150 customers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;5.) Our retention rate for the holiday season year-over-year is therefore: ((1,150 - 350) / 1,000) X 100 = 80%&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This gives you insight into how many dormant customers you&amp;#39;re retaining year-over-year during your seasonal swings.  I would apply this same logic to the off-season, and measure that separately using the same methodology.&lt;/p&gt;

1,fdqguc9,SlightOcelot,1,t2_1sh9yqtk,"This does not really sound like a seasonality problem, which tends to refer to annual events and the effect they have on a business. If it was seasonal, the people who heavily use your product then go dormant, would be doing so in identifiable peaks and troughs as a population, not individually.  Sounds more like the lifecycle of a customer, at least how you have explained it.

Either way, just increase your timeline. If the clients are indeed temporarily dormant, that will show up on a long enough timeline. Otherwise you really do just have low retention rate.

Be careful of making assumptions before you look into the data.

This is very strange to me. If you work in BI you'd have at least a full export from your earlier tool.","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;This does not really sound like a seasonality problem, which tends to refer to annual events and the effect they have on a business.

    "The problem statement highlights I need to find an accurate model to predict subreddit posts. After all this is a classification problem using NLP.\n",

    "So in the 03_Modeling workbook I found an accurate model with the following stats:\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Stats\n",

    "    + accuracy 0.826 vs 0.712 benchmark\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "It was possible to derive key words from the model. However infering anything from them was hard and they werent very insightful.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore in the '04_Further Modelling' workbook I refined a model focused on delivering key words to infer better information at the expense of accuracy. I did this by forcing the model to look for 2 or 3 word phrases rather than singular words. I looked at the posts 'title' to analyse. This is a source of key words and terms. \n",

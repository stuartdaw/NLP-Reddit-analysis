    "\n",
    "#### Multinomial Naive Bayes\n",
    "\n",
    "Explanation\n",
    "+  Naive Bayes models estimate the conditional probability of a particular word being in a target class. The more the word occurs in the class the higher the probability it belongs to that class. It is based on the probabilities not the frequentist approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "Weakness\n",
    "+ It assumes that there is no relationships between words and they could occur in any order. Therefore it can lose so information as it doesnt take this into account.\n",
    "\n",
    "Reason for choosing\n",
    "+ This is renowned for being a very good for NLP model\n",
    "\n",
    "+ It is possible to get the features out afterwards which will be useful for inferential statistics\n",
    "\n",
    "+ The columns will be transformed into integer counts, so MultinomialNB works the best for this.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Logistic regression\n",
    "\n",
    "Explanation\n",
    "+ Another classfication algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "+ Uses a sigmoid function to classify anything with 0.5 probability and above to be a 1, and anything below 0.5 to be a 0\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Reason for choosing\n",
    "+ Coeffients of the features are interpretable which is not true about all models\n",
    "+ It i s an efficient model and good for classification problems\n",
    "+ Common so widely understood\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Measurement\n",
    "\n",
    "Accuracy\n",
    "+ This is the default method Scikit uses to score its test.\n",
    "\n",
    "AUC ROC\n",
    "+ this is the false positive rate plotted against the true positive rate. The closer to 1 the better.\n",
    "\n",
    "+ For the final model I will look at the AUC ROC curve and compare to the benchmrk"

    " #### Key point: \n",
